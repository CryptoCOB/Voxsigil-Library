# File Movement Strategy Report
## Files TO Move to Organized Folders

Based on current analysis, here are the remaining files that should be moved TO their proper categorical folders:

### Interface Files to Consolidate TO `interfaces/`:

**Move from `llm/` to `interfaces/`:**
- `llm/arc_llm_interface.py` → `interfaces/arc_llm_interface.py` (ARC-specific LLM interface)

**Review Duplicates in `interfaces/`:**
- `llm/llm_interface.py` vs `interfaces/llm_interface.py` (Different implementations - keep both as separate)
- `training/rag_interface.py` vs `interfaces/rag_interface.py` (Different implementations - keep both as separate)

### Engine Files to Move TO `engines/`:

Let me check what's in various directories that should go to engines...

**Check for engine files in:**
- `BLT/` - BLT encoder and processors
- `VoxSigilRag/` - RAG processing engines
- `core/` - Core processing engines

### Utility Files to Move TO `utils/`:

**Already in utils/:**
- `utils/numpy_resolver.py` ✓

**Check for scattered utility files in:**
- Root directory utility files
- Helper functions in other directories

### Middleware Files (COMPLETED):
- `VoxSigilRag/voxsigil_middleware.py` → `middleware/voxsigil_middleware.py` ✓
- `VoxSigilRag/voxsigil_blt_middleware.py` → `middleware/voxsigil_blt_middleware.py` ✓
- `BLT/hybrid_middleware.py` → `middleware/hybrid_middleware.py` ✓
- `BLT/blt_compression_middleware.py` → `middleware/blt_compression_middleware.py` ✓
- `BLT/blt_middleware_loader.py` → `middleware/blt_middleware_loader.py` ✓

### VMB Files (COMPLETED):
- `vmb_operations.py` → `vmb/vmb_operations.py` ✓
- `vmb_activation.py` → `vmb/vmb_activation.py` ✓
- `vmb_config_status.py` → `vmb/vmb_config_status.py` ✓

## Next Steps

1. Move `llm/arc_llm_interface.py` to `interfaces/`
2. Check for engine files to move to `engines/`
3. Update import statements after movements
4. Test functionality after reorganization
