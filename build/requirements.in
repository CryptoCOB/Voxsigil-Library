# VoxSigil Library - Requirements (NumPy Fixed)
# Python 3.10+ compatible, optimized for uv package manager
# Install with: uv pip install -r requirements.in (then compile to lock)
# Or: uv pip sync requirements.lock (recommended after compiling)

# IMPORTANT: Install in this order to avoid numpy conflicts:
# 1. Core dependencies (numpy, setuptools, wheel)
# 2. PyTorch 
# 3. Everything else
# (Note: uv's resolver should handle order, but this is a good reference)
