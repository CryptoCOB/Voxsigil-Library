# Launchers Directory

This directory contains all the GUI launcher files.

## Files:
- `Launch_*.bat` - Windows batch launchers  
- `launch_*.py` - Python launcher scripts

## Usage:
Most launchers are legacy. Use the main launcher in the root directory:
`Launch_VoxSigil_Main.bat`

## Legacy Launchers:
These are kept for reference but may point to files that have been moved or removed.
The main launcher is the recommended way to start VoxSigil GUI.
