# VANTA Integration with ART and SleepTimeCompute

## Overview

This document outlines the integration between the VANTA (Supervisor), ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory), and SleepTimeCompute components in the VoxSigil system. These integrations enable advanced pattern recognition, memory consolidation, and cognitive rhythm management.

## Integration Points

### 1. VANTA + ART Integration

The VANTA Supervisor now integrates with the ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) module to:

- Analyze user queries for pattern recognition and categorization
- Train the ART system based on user interactions
- Use ART categories to influence the selection of reasoning scaffolds
- Enhance responses with pattern information from ART

**Key Methods:**
- `train_art_on_interaction()`: Trains the ART system on query-response pairs
- ART analysis integration in `orchestrate_thought_cycle()`

### 2. VANTA + SleepTimeCompute Integration

The VANTA Supervisor now integrates with the SleepTimeCompute module to:

- Queue memories for consolidation during system rest phases
- Trigger memory consolidation proactively based on system load
- Schedule rest phases for pattern compression and memory optimization
- Manage cognitive states (active, rest, deep rest)

**Key Methods:**
- `trigger_memory_consolidation()`: Forces or schedules memory consolidation
- `queue_memory_for_consolidation()`: Adds memories to the consolidation queue

### 3. Diagnostic Integration

The diagnostic system has been extended to:

- Track component interactions between VANTA, ART, and SleepTimeCompute
- Provide test harnesses for validating the integrations
- Instrument all critical methods to ensure proper communication

## Cognitive Flow

1. User query is received by VANTA
2. Query is analyzed by ART for pattern recognition and categorization
3. VANTA orchestrates the response generation
4. Response is trained back into ART for future pattern recognition
5. Memory is queued for consolidation during the next rest phase
6. SleepTimeCompute performs memory consolidation during system downtime

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize components
art_manager = ARTManager()
sleep_time_compute = SleepTimeCompute(external_memory_interface=memory_interface)

# Initialize VANTA with integrated components
vanta = VantaSigilSupervisor(
    rag_interface=rag_interface,
    llm_interface=llm_interface,
    memory_interface=memory_interface,
    art_manager_instance=art_manager,
    sleep_time_compute_instance=sleep_time_compute
)

# Process a query (will use ART for analysis)
result = vanta.orchestrate_thought_cycle("What is the nature of consciousness?")

# Manually trigger memory consolidation
vanta.trigger_memory_consolidation(force_execution=True)
```

## Diagnostics

To test the integration:

```bash
python run_system_diagnostics.py --type vanta
python run_system_diagnostics.py --type art
python run_system_diagnostics.py --type memory_consolidation
```

Or run all diagnostics:

```bash
python run_system_diagnostics.py
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Enhanced Pattern Learning: Deeper integration between ART categories and VANTA's scaffold selection
2. Adaptive Rest Scheduling: Dynamically adjust rest phase timing based on system load
3. Pattern-Based Memory Retrieval: Use ART categories to influence memory retrieval
