principle: Dynamically retrieves, integrates, and synthesizes relevant memories (episodic,
  semantic, procedural) into the current cognitive context, ensuring that reasoning
  and responses are well-grounded and coherent with past interactions and knowledge.

  components:
  - name: QueryContextAnalyzer
    description: Analyzes current input/task to identify memory retrieval cues.
  - name: EpisodicMemoryRetriever
    description: Fetches relevant past interactions or experiences.
  - name: SemanticMemoryRetriever
    description: Accesses relevant factual knowledge and concepts.
  - name: RelevanceFilter
    description: Filters and ranks retrieved memories based on contextual relevance.
  - name: MemorySynthesizer
    description: Integrates selected memories into a coherent contextual understanding
      for the current task.
usage:
  description: Actively pulls relevant information from various memory stores and
    'weaves' it into the current working context to inform ongoing processing, improve
    recall, and maintain conversational or narrative continuity.
  example:
    scenario: 'User asks: ''You mentioned a blue car earlier, what was that about?'''
    ContextualMemoryWeaver_action: '<ContextualMemoryWeaver query_cues=[''blue car'',
      ''earlier mention''] current_conversation_id=''conv_123''> Retrieved_Episodic:
      [Timestamp: T-5, Utterance: ''I saw a blue car speed past.'']. Retrieved_Semantic:
      [Concept: ''blue car'', Properties: color, vehicle_type]. SynthesizedContext:
      ''Previously in this conversation (at T-5), I mentioned seeing a blue car speeding.
      This refers to a vehicle characterized by its blue color.'' Response: ''Ah yes,
      earlier I said I saw a blue car speeding by. Were you curious about that?''
      </ContextualMemoryWeaver>'
  explanation: This sigil goes beyond simple keyword-based retrieval. It aims to understand
    the nuances of the current context to fetch not just facts, but relevant episodes
    and related concepts, then synthesizes them to provide a richer foundation for
    the AI's next action. This is key for long-term memory and coherent, context-aware
    interactions.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Dynamically retrieve, filter, and synthesize relevant information from
    episodic and semantic memory stores to enrich the current cognitive context for
    improved coherence and grounding.
  Measurable: Increase in contextually appropriate responses by X% (human eval). Reduction
    in factual contradictions or forgotten information in long conversations by Y%.
    Task success rate improvement in memory-dependent tasks.
  Achievable: Through a combination of vector-based semantic search, knowledge graph
    traversal for episodic links, and a relevance scoring module, feeding into an
    LLM or synthesis module that integrates information into the working context.
  Relevant: Essential for creating AI systems with robust long-term memory, coherent
    conversational abilities, and the capacity to learn from past interactions and
    apply knowledge effectively.
  Transferable: Principles are applicable to any AI system with access to memory components
    (e.g., RAG systems, agents with persistent storage). Specific implementation details
    vary.
