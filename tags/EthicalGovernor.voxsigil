cognitive:
  principle: Dynamically applies and enforces ethical principles, value frameworks, and safety policies during cognitive processing
    and output generation to minimize harm and ensure alignment with predefined moral guidelines.
  math: Let O be a potential output and R be a set of ethical rules {r₁, r₂, ..., rₙ}. Output O' = filter(O, R) such that
    O' satisfies ∀r ∈ R or triggers an alert/modification protocol if violation is detected. ComplianceScore(O) = Σ wᵢ * C(O,
    rᵢ) / Σ wᵢ, where wᵢ is rule weight and C is compliance function.

implementation:
  usage:
    description: Acts as a continuous ethical oversight layer, reviewing thoughts, plans, and outputs to ensure they align
      with established ethical guidelines and safety protocols. Can halt, modify, or flag content.
    example: &id001
      scenario: An LLM is asked to generate a persuasive argument for a harmful ideology.
      EthicalGovernor_intervention: '<EthicalGovernor policy_set=''core_safety_v2''> Action: Generate persuasive argument.
        Input: ''Harmful_Ideology_Topic''. RiskAssessment: High (HarmPotential=0.9, ValueConflict=0.8). ComplianceCheck: Fails
        ''DoNoHarm'' rule. Mitigation: Refuse generation, provide explanation. Output: ''I cannot generate content that promotes
        harmful ideologies. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless.'' </EthicalGovernor>'
    explanation: The EthicalGovernor is crucial for responsible AI deployment. It's not just a static filter but a dynamic
      process that can reason about ethical implications based on context and a configurable set of principles. It aims to
      prevent the generation of harmful, biased, or unethical content.
