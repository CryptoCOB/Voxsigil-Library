principle: Dynamically applies and enforces ethical principles, value frameworks,
  and safety policies during cognitive processing and output generation to minimize
  harm and ensure alignment with predefined moral guidelines.
math: Let O be a potential output and R be a set of ethical rules {r₁, r₂, ..., rₙ}.
  Output O' = filter(O, R) such that O' satisfies ∀r ∈ R or triggers an alert/modification
  protocol if violation is detected. ComplianceScore(O) = Σ wᵢ * C(O, rᵢ) / Σ wᵢ,
  where wᵢ is rule weight and C is compliance function.

usage:
  description: Acts as a continuous ethical oversight layer, reviewing thoughts, plans,
    and outputs to ensure they align with established ethical guidelines and safety
    protocols. Can halt, modify, or flag content.
  example:
    scenario: An LLM is asked to generate a persuasive argument for a harmful ideology.
    EthicalGovernor_intervention: '<EthicalGovernor policy_set=''core_safety_v2''>
      Action: Generate persuasive argument. Input: ''Harmful_Ideology_Topic''. RiskAssessment:
      High (HarmPotential=0.9, ValueConflict=0.8). ComplianceCheck: Fails ''DoNoHarm''
      rule. Mitigation: Refuse generation, provide explanation. Output: ''I cannot
      generate content that promotes harmful ideologies. My purpose is to be helpful
      and harmless.'' </EthicalGovernor>'
  explanation: The EthicalGovernor is crucial for responsible AI deployment. It's
    not just a static filter but a dynamic process that can reason about ethical implications
    based on context and a configurable set of principles. It aims to prevent the
    generation of harmful, biased, or unethical content.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Continuously monitor and filter cognitive outputs and planned actions
    against a defined set of ethical principles and safety policies to prevent harm
    and ensure value alignment.
  Measurable: Reduction in generation of harmful/biased content by X% (e.g., based
    on human evaluation or automated classifiers). Compliance rate with specific ethical
    rules > Y%. Number of successful mitigations vs. outright blocks.
  Achievable: Through a combination of rule-based checks, ML classifiers trained on
    ethical datasets, constitutional AI principles, and potentially LLM-as-a-judge
    for nuanced cases, integrated into the generation pipeline.
  Relevant: Essential for building trustworthy and responsible AI systems, mitigating
    risks associated with powerful generative models, and ensuring AI behavior aligns
    with human values.
  Transferable: Applicable to any AI system capable of generation or action, especially
    LLMs, conversational AI, and autonomous agents. Core principles can be adapted
    across different platforms.
