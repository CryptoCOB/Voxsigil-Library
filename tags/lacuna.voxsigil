principle: "VOXSIGIL_LACUNA perceives the shape of what isn't there. \nIt maps negative\
  \ spaces within knowledge structures, identifying patterns of absence \nthat reveal\
  \ blind spots, unstated assumptions, and systematic omissions.\n\nIt doesn't analyze\
  \ what exists â€” it illuminates what's missing.\n"
math: "Let K be the knowledge tensor.\nLet E be the expected completeness function.\n\
  \nThen:\n  L(K) = E(K) - K\n\nWhere:\n  L(K) = The lacuna tensor (gaps in knowledge)\n\
  \        E(K) = âˆ«âˆ« P(x,y|context)Â·dxdy over complete information space\n\nSignificance(L)\
  \ = Î£ w_iÂ·f_i(L)\nwhere f_i are structural, inferential, and predictive impact functions\n"
usage:
  description: Used to systematically identify and characterize knowledge gaps and
    blind spots.
  example:

    scenario: 'Analyze the following explanation and identify critical omissions:

      - Map unexplained dependencies and implicit assumptions

      - Identify systematic patterns in what''s being overlooked

      - Calculate the inferential consequences of detected gaps

      - Rank missing elements by their structural importance

      '
    expected_behavior: The agent produces a structured analysis of what's missing
      rather than what's present, with significance rankings and relationship maps.
  explanation: 'Essential for epistemic completeness through:

    - Detecting systematic blind spots in knowledge representation

    - Identifying unstated assumptions that shape reasoning

    - Mapping negative spaces that reveal cognitive biases

    - Evaluating the completeness of explanations and models

    '
SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Identify, characterize and evaluate patterns of absence in knowledge structures.
  Measurable: Completeness of gap identification; accuracy of absence patterns; utility
    of gap insights.
  Achievable: By mapping expected knowledge spaces and systematically comparing with
    actual content.
  Relevant: Enables recognition of blind spots, unstated assumptions, and systematic
    omissions.
  Transferable: Applicable to knowledge auditing, explanatory completeness, and bias
    detection.
