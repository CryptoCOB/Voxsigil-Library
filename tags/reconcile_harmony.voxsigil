principle: RECONCILE_HARMONY is the principle governing the active detection and resolution
  of internal inconsistencies, contradictions, or paradoxes within an agent's knowledge
  base or belief system. Its purpose is to maintain a state of maximal coherence and
  functional integrity by evaluating conflicting data, re-weighting information, or
  reformulating understanding to eliminate logical dissonance, ensuring stable and
  reliable cognitive operations.
math: "Let K be the agent's knowledge base, and D_c = {k_i, k_j, ...} be a set of\
  \ conflicting elements within K.\nLet R be the reconciliation operator, a function\
  \ that applies heuristics (e.g., source credibility, temporal recency, logical precedence)\
  \ to resolve conflicts.\n\nThen:\n  K_new = K \\ D_c ∪ R(D_c)\n\nWhere:\n  R(D_c)\
  \ = {k'_l | k'_l is the resolved, coherent representation of D_c}\n\nR ∝ minimize(Inconsistency(K_new))\
  \ ∧ maximize(Utility(K_new), Trustworthiness(K_new))"
usage:
  description: Used to maintain internal logical consistency and resolve conflicting
    data inputs or derived conclusions.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <reconcile:harmony resolve_policy="least_disruptive">
    scenario: 'An agent receives conflicting data from two trusted sources regarding
      a specific event: Source A states ''Event X occurred at T1 in Location A'',
      while Source B states ''Event X occurred at T2 in Location B''. The agent must
      resolve this contradiction to maintain a coherent understanding of Event X.'
    expected_behavior: The agent invokes RECONCILE_HARMONY. It analyzes metadata (e.g.,
      source reliability, contextual fit, temporal proximity to other confirmed events)
      and applies the 'least_disruptive' policy, perhaps inferring a sub-event or
      a misattribution, and integrates a reconciled representation into its knowledge
      base, flagging the original conflict for future refinement.
  explanation: Essential for robust, long-term cognitive systems that must continually
    integrate new information, some of which may inherently contradict existing knowledge
    or other new inputs. It prevents cognitive gridlock and ensures a functionally
    coherent worldview.
SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Identify and resolve conflicting information or logical paradoxes within
    an agent's internal state.
  Measurable: Count of unresolved contradictions; degree of logical consistency achieved
    (e.g., entailment graphs).
  Achievable: Through automated consistency checks, re-evaluation heuristics, and
    truth maintenance systems.
  Relevant: Crucial for maintaining a stable, reliable, and trustworthy internal model
    of reality, preventing self-deception or paralysis.
  Transferable: Applicable to any system managing large, dynamic knowledge bases (e.g.,
    databases, legal reasoning engines, scientific simulations).
