  principle: RECONCILE_HARMONY is the principle governing the active detection and resolution of internal inconsistencies,
    contradictions, or paradoxes within an agent's knowledge base or belief system. Its purpose is to maintain a state of
    maximal coherence and functional integrity by evaluating conflicting data, re-weighting information, or reformulating
    understanding to eliminate logical dissonance, ensuring stable and reliable cognitive operations.
  math: "Let K be the agent's knowledge base, and D_c = {k_i, k_j, ...} be a set of conflicting elements within K.\nLet R\
    \ be the reconciliation operator, a function that applies heuristics (e.g., source credibility, temporal recency, logical\
    \ precedence) to resolve conflicts.\n\nThen:\n  K_new = K \\ D_c ∪ R(D_c)\n\nWhere:\n  R(D_c) = {k'_l | k'_l is the resolved,\
    \ coherent representation of D_c}\n\nR ∝ minimize(Inconsistency(K_new)) ∧ maximize(Utility(K_new), Trustworthiness(K_new))"

      invocation_tag: <reconcile:harmony resolve_policy="least_disruptive">
      scenario: 'An agent receives conflicting data from two trusted sources regarding a specific event: Source A states ''Event
        X occurred at T1 in Location A'', while Source B states ''Event X occurred at T2 in Location B''. The agent must resolve
        this contradiction to maintain a coherent understanding of Event X.'
      expected_behavior: The agent invokes RECONCILE_HARMONY. It analyzes metadata (e.g., source reliability, contextual fit,
        temporal proximity to other confirmed events) and applies the 'least_disruptive' policy, perhaps inferring a sub-event
        or a misattribution, and integrates a reconciled representation into its knowledge base, flagging the original conflict
        for future refinement.
    explanation: Essential for robust, long-term cognitive systems that must continually integrate new information, some of
      which may inherently contradict existing knowledge or other new inputs. It prevents cognitive gridlock and ensures a
      functionally coherent worldview.
