principle: Applies a soft or hard cap on the depth of recursive thought or reflective
  processes, preventing runaway recursion, infinite regress, or excessive cognitive
  load. Derived from principles of metarecursion control and logic-safe descent in
  knowledge graphs.
math: 'Let D_current be the current recursion depth and T_steps be the total reasoning
  steps taken.

  Effective Max Depth (D_eff_max) = min(D_user_spec, f(T_steps))

  where D_user_spec is a user-defined maximum depth.

  f(T_steps) could be a dynamic cap, e.g., φ * ln(T_steps) as suggested (φ ≈ 1.618),
  or a simpler fixed internal limit.

  Action if D_current ≥ D_eff_max: Halt, Summarize, or Fold.'

usage:
  description: Applies a configurable soft cap on how deep a reflective or recursive
    cognitive process can go before halting, summarizing its current state, or folding
    deeper layers into compressed summaries.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <mirror:limit max_depth=5 on_limit_action='summarize_and_return'>
      Reflect on the implications of the last 5 thought loops regarding the user's
      query. </mirror:limit>
    scenario: An AI is engaged in a deep reflective process. To prevent excessive
      navel-gazing or computational cost, MirrorLimit ensures that after 5 levels
      of reflection, it summarizes its findings and returns to a higher level.
    expected_behavior: The AI reflects up to 5 levels. If it attempts a 6th, it instead
      summarizes levels 1-5 and uses that summary as the outcome of the reflection.
  explanation: This sigil is crucial for maintaining cognitive stability and preventing
    runaway recursion or infinite regress in systems that employ self-reflection or
    recursive reasoning (<mirror> patterns). By setting a depth limit, it ensures
    that reflective processes remain bounded. When the limit is reached, the system
    can be configured to simply halt, or more usefully, to summarize the insights
    gained from the deeper layers, effectively folding them into a more concise representation.
activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Initiation of a recursive or reflective thought process.
  - Monitoring ongoing recursive operations to prevent over-extension.
  preconditions:
  - The system employs recursive or reflective mechanisms.
  - A clear definition of 'depth' is applicable to the process.
  required_capabilities:
  - recursion_depth_tracking
  - conditional_halting
  - summarization (if on_limit_action is summarize)
  supported_modalities:
  - programmatic_api
  - internal_system_configuration
  contraindications:
  - Processes that are inherently shallow and non-recursive.
  - When the exact required depth is unknown and any premature capping is detrimental
    (though this sigil aims for 'soft' caps).

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Apply a configurable cap on the depth of recursive thought or self-reflection
    (<mirror>) to prevent runaway processes, halting or summarizing at the limit.
  Measurable: Reasoning cycles/recursion depth limited to the specified cap. Reduction
    in hallucination or off-topic drift in deep recursive tasks by ~18% (as per user
    input). Time spent in recursive loops bounded.
  Achievable: By implementing a recursive depth counter within the Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) or thought process controller, and capping node traversal or further
    recursive calls when the counter reaches the specified limit.
  Relevant: Critical for ensuring safe and stable recursion, preventing infinite regress,
    managing computational resources, and maintaining prompt stability in LLMs employing
    reflective patterns.
  Transferable: Applicable to any reasoning-capable LLM or AI system that implements
    or simulates recursive reflection, meta-reasoning, or iterative self-correction
    loops.
