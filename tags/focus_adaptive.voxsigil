  principle: FOCUS_ADAPTIVE orchestrates the dynamic allocation of an agent's cognitive resources by modulating attentional
    weights across vast information landscapes. It ensures that processing effort is disproportionately applied to information
    deemed most relevant to current goals, contextual shifts, or emergent salient cues, thereby optimizing efficiency and
    responsiveness in highly dynamic environments.
  math: "Let I_t be the input information stream at time t.\nLet C_t be the current context and O_t be the current objectives.\n\
    Let P_t-1 be the prior attentional state/vector.\n\nThen:\n  A_t = W(I_t, C_t, O_t, P_t-1)\n  I_processed = I_t ⋅ A_t\n\
    \nWhere:\n  A_t is the attention vector at time t, with weights w_i ∈ [0,1].\n  W is the dynamic weighting function, designed\
    \ to maximize(Utility(I_processed, O_t))."

      scenario: An agent is monitoring a complex system's logs (high volume, varied topics). Initially, its goal is 'anomaly
        detection'. Suddenly, a user query arrives focusing on 'network performance metrics'. The agent must rapidly shift
        its attention and processing filters.
      expected_behavior: FOCUS_ADAPTIVE is invoked. The change in objective and context (user query) triggers a re-evaluation
        of salience. The agent's attention weights shift from general anomaly patterns to specific keywords and log entries
        related to network performance, filtering out irrelevant information and prioritizing deep processing for the newly
        relevant data stream segments.
    explanation: Crucial for AI models operating in environments with fluctuating information density and shifting user or
      system demands. It prevents cognitive overload and ensures efficient resource utilization by intelligently pruning irrelevant
      data and prioritizing deep dives.
