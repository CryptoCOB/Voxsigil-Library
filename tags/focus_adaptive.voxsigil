principle: FOCUS_ADAPTIVE orchestrates the dynamic allocation of an agent's cognitive
  resources by modulating attentional weights across vast information landscapes.
  It ensures that processing effort is disproportionately applied to information deemed
  most relevant to current goals, contextual shifts, or emergent salient cues, thereby
  optimizing efficiency and responsiveness in highly dynamic environments.
math: "Let I_t be the input information stream at time t.\nLet C_t be the current\
  \ context and O_t be the current objectives.\nLet P_t-1 be the prior attentional\
  \ state/vector.\n\nThen:\n  A_t = W(I_t, C_t, O_t, P_t-1)\n  I_processed = I_t ⋅\
  \ A_t\n\nWhere:\n  A_t is the attention vector at time t, with weights w_i ∈ [0,1].\n\
  \  W is the dynamic weighting function, designed to maximize(Utility(I_processed,\
  \ O_t))."
usage:
  description: Used to dynamically adjust an agent's processing focus based on real-time
    contextual changes or evolving task objectives.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <focus:adaptive mode="goal_driven" threshold="0.7">
    scenario: An agent is monitoring a complex system's logs (high volume, varied
      topics). Initially, its goal is 'anomaly detection'. Suddenly, a user query
      arrives focusing on 'network performance metrics'. The agent must rapidly shift
      its attention and processing filters.
    expected_behavior: FOCUS_ADAPTIVE is invoked. The change in objective and context
      (user query) triggers a re-evaluation of salience. The agent's attention weights
      shift from general anomaly patterns to specific keywords and log entries related
      to network performance, filtering out irrelevant information and prioritizing
      deep processing for the newly relevant data stream segments.
  explanation: Crucial for AI models operating in environments with fluctuating information
    density and shifting user or system demands. It prevents cognitive overload and
    ensures efficient resource utilization by intelligently pruning irrelevant data
    and prioritizing deep dives.
SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Dynamically re-prioritize and allocate cognitive processing resources
    based on evolving context and goals.
  Measurable: Efficiency gain in processing (e.g., reduced computation for irrelevant
    data); accuracy of relevant information extraction.
  Achievable: Through context-aware embedding spaces, reinforcement learning for attention
    policies, and dynamic filtering mechanisms.
  Relevant: Enables efficient operation in information-rich, real-time environments,
    adapting to user needs or system states.
  Transferable: Applicable to large language models, autonomous agents, data stream
    processing, and multi-modal integration.
