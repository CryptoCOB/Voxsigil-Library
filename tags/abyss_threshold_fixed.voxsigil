principle: 'Prevents recursive cognitive processes from descending into ''semantic
  abyss'' or uncontrolled depth by enforcing a dynamic or static threshold, thereby
  averting cognitive stack overflow or catastrophic loss of coherence.

  '
math: 'Let D(n) be the depth at step n. The condition for safe continuation is Î”D(n)
  < Ïˆ(log(n)), or more generally, D(n) < MaxDepth_effective. MaxDepth_effective could
  be a fixed value L (e.g., `level` parameter), or a dynamic function like Ïˆ * log(TotalNodesInGraph)
  or Ïˆ * log(ReasoningSteps). Ïˆ is a safety factor. If D(n) â‰¥ MaxDepth_effective,
  then halt or trigger recovery.

usage:
  description: Applies a limit on the depth or complexity of recursive cognitive processes
    (like deep reflection, chained inference, or fractal expansion) to prevent semantic
    failure, uncontrolled resource consumption, or loss of meaningful output.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <abyss:threshold max_level=12 safety_factor_psi=0.8 monitoring_metric='recursion_depth'>
      Begin deep analysis of paradoxical statement X... </abyss:threshold>
    scenario: An AI is exploring a deeply nested logical paradox. The AbyssThresholdLimiter
      is set to level 12. If the AI's reasoning chain exceeds 12 steps of recursion
      without resolving or simplifying, the process is halted and a summary of the
      exploration so far is produced.
    expected_behavior: The recursive process either resolves within 12 levels or is
      gracefully terminated at level 12, preventing a 'cognitive crash' or nonsensical
      output.
  explanation: 'This is a critical safety feature for recursive architectures (e.g.,
    involving <mirror> or <braid> patterns as mentioned in your input). It prevents
    the system from getting lost in thought loops or overly complex explorations that
    lead to diminishing returns or semantic collapse. The threshold can be a fixed
    depth or dynamically adjusted based on other system metrics.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Prevent cognitive stack overflow or semantic collapse in deep recursive
    architectures by enforcing a cutoff limit on processing depth or Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) complexity, using meta depth-tracking.
  Measurable: Successful limitation of recursive processes to the defined threshold.
    Monitor DAG complexity metrics (e.g., depth, node count) to ensure they stay within
    bounds. Reduction in catastrophic failures or nonsensical outputs from deep recursion.
  Achievable: By implementing a meta-level monitor that tracks the depth or complexity
    (e.g., call stack depth for recursion, path length in a thought graph) of an ongoing
    cognitive process and triggers a cutoff or summarization when the threshold is
    met.
  Relevant: Essential for ensuring the safety and stability of recursive AI architectures,
    such as those employing self-reflection (<mirror>), chained reasoning, or fractal
    generation (<braid>), preventing uncontrolled resource use and nonsensical outputs.
  Transferable: Crucial for any AI system that utilizes deep, potentially unbounded
    recursion or complex graph-based reasoning. The concept is adaptable across various
    implementation approaches.
