cognitive:
  principle: Reinforces the importance or salience of preceding logic, key directives, or contextual elements by subtly reintroducing
    them, increasing their weight in attention mechanisms, or echoing their core semantic meaning, thereby enhancing recall,
    persistence, and focus.
  math: 'Let wᵢ be the attention weight or salience score of cognitive node/token i. If node k is targeted for reinforcement:
    w''ₖ = wₖ + α * R(k), where α is a reinforcement factor and R(k) is relevance or importance of k. Alternatively, for instruction
    I, re-inject paraphrased_I(I) into working memory with increased salience.'

  usage:
    description: Subtly repeats or re-emphasizes a key directive, piece of information, or a line of reasoning to ensure it
      remains focal in the AI's cognitive process and isn't lost or diluted over time or by distracting inputs.

    explanation: This sigil helps maintain focus, especially in long interactions or complex multi-step reasoning. It acts
      like a gentle nudge, reminding the AI of what's important without being overly prescriptive. The reinforcement can be
      achieved by literally re-injecting a weighted copy of the target, or by adjusting attention biases towards concepts
      related to the target logic. The 'LLMs with embedded vector bias' suggests a technical way to achieve this.
