usage:
  description: Applying recursive patterns in symbolic reasoning for complex problem-solving,
    analysis, or generation tasks that benefit from self-similar processing at multiple
    levels of abstraction.
  example:
    task: Hierarchical symbolic decomposition of a complex problem statement.
    input: 'Problem: ''Optimize global supply chain for sustainable energy components
      considering geopolitical risks and material scarcity.'''
    recursive_logic_sketch: "R(ProblemStatement):\n  IF ProblemStatement is atomic_and_solvable\
      \ THEN Analyze(ProblemStatement)\n  ELSE \n    SubProblems = Decompose(ProblemStatement\
      \ into KeyThemes/Constraints)\n    Solutions = []\n    FOR SP in SubProblems:\
      \ Solutions.append(R(SP))\n    RETURN SynthesizeSolutions(Solutions, OriginalContext(ProblemStatement))\n"
    explanation_of_example: The main problem is recursively broken down into smaller,
      more manageable sub-problems (e.g., 'sustainable energy components', 'geopolitical
      risks', 'material scarcity'). Each sub-problem is then addressed recursively
      until a base level of analysis is possible. The solutions/analyses are then
      synthesized back up the hierarchy.
  explanation: 'This sigil represents reasoning processes that call upon themselves,
    either directly or indirectly, to operate on progressively simpler, more abstract,
    or transformed versions of an initial symbolic input. It''s fundamental for tasks
    like parsing hierarchical structures (e.g., language, code), meta-reasoning (reasoning
    about reasoning), exploring fractal-like problem spaces, and any situation where
    a problem can be defined in terms of smaller instances of itself. Examples include
    self-referential symbolic processes, hierarchical symbolic decomposition, and
    meta-symbolic reasoning about reasoning systems.

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Problem exhibits a nested or self-similar structure.
  - A task requires iterative refinement or exploration at multiple levels of detail.
  - Need for meta-level analysis of symbolic systems or processes.
  - Generation of fractal or hierarchically organized symbolic output is required.
  preconditions:
  - The set of symbols and operations are well-defined and understood by the system.
  - The problem can be meaningfully broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
  - Clear base cases for terminating the recursion can be defined.
  - Mechanisms for managing recursion depth and state are in place.

  - pattern_recognition

  supported_modalities:
  - symbolic_input
  - textual_problem_description
  - programmatic_api
  contraindications:
  - Problem is inherently linear or flat, lacking recursive structure.
  - Base cases are ill-defined, leading to infinite recursion.
  - The overhead of recursion (e.g., stack depth, repeated computations) outweighs
    benefits compared to iterative solutions.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Enable the recursive application of symbolic operators or reasoning patterns
    to an input, transforming it through self-referential steps towards a base case
    or solution.
  Measurable: Depth of recursion achieved, breadth of symbolic transformation at each
    level, reduction in problem complexity per step, or successful attainment of defined
    base cases. Number of distinct symbolic states explored.
  Achievable: Through programmatic implementation of recursive functions operating
    on symbolic data structures, or by LLMs guided to iteratively self-reference and
    meta-analyze inputs according to recursive rules.
  Relevant: Essential for problems requiring multi-level symbolic interpretation,
    hierarchical decomposition, generation of complex nested structures, or meta-cognitive
    analysis of symbolic systems.
  Transferable: Applicable across any domain requiring nested symbolic reasoning,
    from formal language parsing and theorem proving to creative generation and complex
    system modeling.
