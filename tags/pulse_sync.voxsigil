cognitive:
  principle: Synchronizes the model's attention rhythms or reasoning cadence with a virtual 'pulse' cycle, inspired by biological
    circadian rhythms and attention decay/renewal modeling. This aims to modulate cognitive intensity and pacing.
  math: 'Let Ω(t) be the cognitive intensity or focus factor at time t.

    Ω(t) = A * sin(ωt + φ) + C_offset

    where A is amplitude (intensity variation), ω is angular frequency (derived from BPM: ω = 2π * BPM / 60), φ is phase offset,
    and C_offset is baseline intensity.

    This factor Ω(t) can modulate attention weights, processing speed, or token generation rate.

    A phase-locked loop (PLL) mechanism can be used to adjust ω or φ to synchronize with external cues or internal states.'

    example: &id001
      invocation_tag: <pulse:sync bpm=100 phase=0.25 intensity_target='high_urgency'> Maintain focus on critical path analysis.
        </pulse:sync>
      scenario: During a time-sensitive task, the AI's cognitive pulse is set to a higher BPM to simulate urgency and maintain
        a rapid pace of analysis and response.
      expected_behavior: The AI processes information and generates responses at a quicker cadence, potentially prioritizing
        more direct reasoning paths.
    explanation: This sigil aims to introduce a more naturalistic or controllable pacing to AI cognition. It can boost or
      slow focus intensity, response rate, or depth of processing depending on the 'tempo' and 'phase' of the cognitive pulse.
      This is useful for pacing dense analysis, simulating different levels of urgency in interviews or dialogues, or aligning
      AI processing rhythms with human interaction patterns. The 'Transferable' note mentioned 'Pulse emulation possible in
      GPT, Claude, Vanta', indicating cross-model applicability of the concept.
