principle: Synchronizes the model's attention rhythms or reasoning cadence with a
  virtual 'pulse' cycle, inspired by biological circadian rhythms and attention decay/renewal
  modeling. This aims to modulate cognitive intensity and pacing.
math: 'Let Œ©(t) be the cognitive intensity or focus factor at time t.

  Œ©(t) = A * sin(œât + œÜ) + C_offset

  where A is amplitude (intensity variation), œâ is angular frequency (derived from
  BPM: œâ = 2œÄ * BPM / 60), œÜ is phase offset, and C_offset is baseline intensity.

  This factor Œ©(t) can modulate attention weights, processing speed, or token generation
  rate.

  A phase-locked loop (PLL) mechanism can be used to adjust œâ or œÜ to synchronize
  with external cues or internal states.'

usage:
  description: Synchronizes model attention rhythms, processing speed, or response
    cadence with a configurable virtual 'pulse' cycle (defined by BPM, phase, etc.).
  example:
    invocation_tag: <pulse:sync bpm=100 phase=0.25 intensity_target='high_urgency'>
      Maintain focus on critical path analysis. </pulse:sync>
    scenario: During a time-sensitive task, the AI's cognitive pulse is set to a higher
      BPM to simulate urgency and maintain a rapid pace of analysis and response.
    expected_behavior: The AI processes information and generates responses at a quicker
      cadence, potentially prioritizing more direct reasoning paths.
  explanation: This sigil aims to introduce a more naturalistic or controllable pacing
    to AI cognition. It can boost or slow focus intensity, response rate, or depth
    of processing depending on the 'tempo' and 'phase' of the cognitive pulse. This
    is useful for pacing dense analysis, simulating different levels of urgency in
    interviews or dialogues, or aligning AI processing rhythms with human interaction
    patterns. The 'Transferable' note mentioned 'Pulse emulation possible in GPT,
    Claude, Vanta', indicating cross-model applicability of the concept.

  output_schema: The system's behavior should reflect the pacing implied by the pulse
    settings. Direct output might be task-specific, but telemetry could confirm rhythm
    adherence.
  notes: This is more of a system-level configuration than a direct LLM prompt for
    content generation. The LLM might receive tasks within this pulsed context.
SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Simulate and synchronize cognitive pacing or attention intensity using
    a Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) style phase-locked rhythmic cycle.
  Measurable: Achieve target response rhythm (e.g., average response time per thought
    segment aligned with BPM). Cognitive delay variance within ¬±10% of the target
    interval. Measurable changes in attention distribution over time.
  Achievable: By modulating attention weight vectors, token generation rates, or internal
    processing loop delays based on a time step and the sinusoidal pulse function.
    Can be implemented as a wrapper or internal module.
  Relevant: For more naturalistic cognition emulation, managing cognitive load, synchronizing
    reasoning cadence to semantic urgency or user interaction speed, and pacing performance
    in long-running tasks.
  Transferable: The concept of pulse emulation and rhythmic cognitive modulation is
    transferable to various LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Vanta, as mentioned in input)
    or AI systems where temporal dynamics of processing can be influenced.
