cognitive:
  principle: 'Prevents recursive cognitive processes from descending into ''semantic abyss'' or uncontrolled depth by enforcing
    a dynamic or static threshold, thereby averting cognitive stack overflow or catastrophic loss of coherence.

    '
  math: 'Let D(n) be the depth at step n. The condition for safe continuation is ΔD(n) < ψ(log(n)), or more generally, D(n)
    < MaxDepth_effective. MaxDepth_effective could be a fixed value L (e.g., `level` parameter), or a dynamic function like
    ψ * log(TotalNodesInGraph) or ψ * log(ReasoningSteps). ψ is a safety factor. If D(n) ≥ MaxDepth_effective, then halt or
    trigger recovery.

      description: Computes relevant metrics (e.g., graph depth, path length, node count) for threshold comparison.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Applies a limit on the depth or complexity of recursive cognitive processes (like deep reflection, chained
      inference, or fractal expansion) to prevent semantic failure, uncontrolled resource consumption, or loss of meaningful
      output.

      scenario: An AI is exploring a deeply nested logical paradox. The AbyssThresholdLimiter is set to level 12. If the AI's
        reasoning chain exceeds 12 steps of recursion without resolving or simplifying, the process is halted and a summary
        of the exploration so far is produced.
      expected_behavior: The recursive process either resolves within 12 levels or is gracefully terminated at level 12, preventing
        a 'cognitive crash' or nonsensical output.
    explanation: This is a critical safety feature for recursive architectures (e.g., involving <mirror> or <braid> patterns
      as mentioned in your input). It prevents the system from getting lost in thought loops or overly complex explorations
      that lead to diminishing returns or semantic collapse. The threshold can be a fixed depth or dynamically adjusted based
      on other system metrics.
