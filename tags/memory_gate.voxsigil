principle: Controls access to and activation of memories based on the current context,
  task, or explicit permissions, effectively compartmentalizing information and filtering
  which memories become active or influence current cognitive processes.
math: Let M be the total memory store. For a given context C and access list L_C,
  the active memory M_active = {m ∈ M | IsRelevant(m, C) AND HasAccess(m, L_C)}. G
  = {m ∈ M | GetTags(m) ∩ access_list ≠ ∅} where GetTags(m) are tags associated with
  memory item m.

  components:
  - name: ContextAnalyzer
    description: Determines the current task context, user identity, or active project.
  - name: AccessPolicyEnforcer
    description: Retrieves and applies relevant access control lists (ACLs) or permission
      rules for the current context.
  - name: MemoryTagMatcher
    description: Matches contextual cues or explicit permissions against tags or metadata
      associated with memory items.
  - name: ActivationFilter
    description: Allows or blocks the retrieval and activation of specific memories
      based on policy and matching.
usage:
  description: Filters which memories are allowed to activate or be retrieved based
    on contextual tags, task relevance, or permission lists. Helps in managing different
    knowledge domains or maintaining privacy between user sessions or tasks.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <memory:gate allow_tags=['task_A_project_XYZ', 'user_Alice_confidential']
      disallow_tags=['outdated_info_v1']> AI, continue working on project XYZ. </memory:gate>
    scenario: An AI works on multiple projects for different users. When 'user_Alice'
      starts a session for 'project_XYZ', the MemoryGate ensures only memories tagged
      relevant to Alice and project XYZ (and not tagged as outdated) are primarily
      accessed, preventing information leakage from 'project_ABC' or 'user_Bob'.
    expected_behavior: The AI's responses and internal reasoning are based predominantly
      on memories relevant to the allowed tags, effectively isolating contexts.
  explanation: This sigil is crucial for managing information in complex AI systems
    that handle diverse tasks, multiple users, or sensitive data. It allows for compartmentalization,
    ensuring that only relevant and permitted memories are active at any given time.
    This supports long-term planning, efficient task switching, and can be a component
    of privacy-preserving AI.
activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Start of a new task or user session.
  - Switching between different projects or conversational contexts.
  - Accessing sensitive information that requires permission checks.
  - Need to scope memory retrieval to a specific domain.
  preconditions:
  - Memories are tagged or associated with metadata (e.g., task ID, user ID, sensitivity
    level, topic).
  - A system for defining and managing access policies or allow/disallow lists.

  - metadata_based_retrieval
  - access_control_logic
  - context_identification
  - dynamic_memory_filtering
  supported_modalities:
  - internal_memory_system_configuration
  - programmatic_api_for_access_control
  contraindications:
  - When broad, unconstrained access to all memories is necessary for holistic reasoning
    (unless gates are explicitly opened).

  notes: This sigil describes a system component for memory systems. An LLM's interaction
    would be by operating within a context where memory retrieval is already gated.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Control memory access by context, filtering which memories activate or
    are retrieved based on contextual tags (e.g., 'task_A') and predefined access
    lists.
  Measurable: Precision vs. recall trade-off in memory retrieval can be tuned. X%
    reduction in irrelevant memories retrieved for a given task. Successful isolation
    of memories between N distinct contexts/tasks.
  Achievable: By implementing memory scoping in retrieval systems (e.g., RAGs where
    documents are tagged and queries are augmented with context tags) or by using
    knowledge graphs with relationship-based access control. Requires memories to
    be tagged or metadata-enriched.
  Relevant: Crucial for long-term planning (focusing on relevant past plans), efficient
    task switching (avoiding cross-task interference), maintaining data compartmentalization
    for security/privacy, and managing cognitive load by reducing irrelevant information.
  Transferable: Essential for any memory-aware LLMs or AI systems that handle multiple
    contexts, users, or projects. The concept of context-gated memory is broadly applicable.
