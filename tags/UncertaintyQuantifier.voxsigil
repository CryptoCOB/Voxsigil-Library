principle: Breaks down complex, high-level goals into a manageable hierarchy of simpler
  subgoals and actionable steps, creating a structured plan for achieving the overall
  objective.
math:
  ? Given Goal G, produce Plan P = { (sg‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÅ), (sg‚ÇÇ, A‚ÇÇ), ..., (sg‚Çô, A‚Çô) } where
    sg·µ¢ are subgoals and A·µ¢ are sequences of actions to achieve sg·µ¢. Subgoals can
    be recursive
  : sg·µ¢ ‚Üí P·µ¢'. Minimize PlanCost(P) subject to G being achieved. Cost can be

usage:
  description: Takes a high-level goal and breaks it into a structured plan of subgoals
    and specific actions. Can be iterative, refining the plan as new information becomes
    available.
  example:
    high_level_goal: Write a research paper on climate change impact on agriculture.
    GoalDecompositionPlanner_output: "<GoalDecompositionPlanner goal='Write research\
      \ paper...'>\n  Plan:\n  1. Subgoal: Conduct Literature Review\n     - Action:\
      \ Search academic databases (keywords: climate change, agriculture, impact)\n\
      \     - Action: Read and synthesize 20 relevant papers\n     - Action: Identify\
      \ key themes and gaps\n  2. Subgoal: Formulate Research Question & Hypothesis\n\
      \     - Action: Refine scope based on literature review\n     - Action: Draft\

  explanation: This sigil enables systematic problem-solving. Instead of attempting
    a complex goal monolithically, it breaks it into smaller, more achievable parts.
    This is fundamental for any sophisticated task execution, from writing code to
    planning a project.

  - Presented with a complex, multi-step goal.

  - Knowledge of potential actions or methods relevant to the goal domain.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Decompose a given complex, high-level goal into a hierarchical and actionable
    plan consisting of clearly defined subgoals and the steps required to achieve
    them.
  Measurable: Completeness of the plan (all necessary components of the main goal
    addressed). Logical coherence of subgoals and action sequences. Reduction in task
    ambiguity by X%. Success rate of executing the generated plan.
  Achievable: Using techniques like Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, means-ends
    analysis, or by prompting an LLM with instructions to break down a goal, leveraging
    its world knowledge for plausible steps and sub-steps.
  Relevant: Fundamental for autonomous agents, project management AI assistants, complex
    problem-solving systems, and any AI tasked with executing multi-step objectives.
  Transferable: The core concept of goal decomposition is widely applicable. LLMs
    can perform this reasonably well for many domains. Specialized planning algorithms
    can be used for more formal or constrained environments.
