  principle: Breaks down complex, high-level goals into a manageable hierarchy of simpler subgoals and actionable steps, creating
    a structured plan for achieving the overall objective.
  math:
    ? Given Goal G, produce Plan P = { (sg₁, A₁), (sg₂, A₂), ..., (sgₙ, Aₙ) } where sgᵢ are subgoals and Aᵢ are sequences
      of actions to achieve sgᵢ. Subgoals can be recursive
    : sgᵢ → Pᵢ'. Minimize PlanCost(P) subject to G being achieved. Cost can be

  usage:
    description: Takes a high-level goal and breaks it into a structured plan of subgoals and specific actions. Can be iterative,
      refining the plan as new information becomes available.

    explanation: This sigil enables systematic problem-solving. Instead of attempting a complex goal monolithically, it breaks
      it into smaller, more achievable parts. This is fundamental for any sophisticated task execution, from writing code
      to planning a project.
