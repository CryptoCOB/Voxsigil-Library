cognitive:
  principle: Emulates quantum-like cognitive superposition, allowing the system to hold and explore multiple, potentially
    contradictory, truths or states in parallel until a decision point (e.g., output tokenization) forces a 'collapse' to
    a single, definite state.
  math: 'Let Ψ(x) represent the cognitive state concerning x.

    Ψ(x) = Σᵢ cᵢ|stateᵢ⟩, where |stateᵢ⟩ are orthonormal basis states (e.g., alternative interpretations, hypotheses) and
    cᵢ are complex amplitudes.

    Probability of collapsing to stateₖ: P(stateₖ) = |cₖ|².

    Normalization: Σᵢ |cᵢ|² = 1.

    Collapse is triggered at a decision threshold or decoding step, selecting one state based on these probabilities or a
    heuristic (e.g., highest probability in beam search).'

implementation:
  usage:
    description: Introduces deliberate ambiguity or forks cognitive logic to explore multiple pathways or interpretations
      simultaneously until one answer or perspective dominates or is selected, often analogous to a collapse in beam search.

      scenario: An AI is analyzing a controversial artifact. It maintains both possibilities ('relic', 'hoax') in superposition,
        gathering and weighing evidence for each. Upon completing evidence evaluation, it collapses to the most probable state.
      expected_output_after_collapse: 'Collapsed state: ''The artifact is an elaborate hoax''. Supporting rationale: [summary
        of strongest evidence for hoax].'
    explanation: This sigil allows an LLM or cognitive system to hold multiple perspectives, hypotheses, or contradictory
      ideas simultaneously, much like a quantum system exists in a superposition of states. This is useful for tasks involving
      paradoxes, generating dual narratives, speculative reasoning, or exploring complex scenarios with inherent uncertainty.
      The 'collapse' occurs when the system needs to produce a definite output or make a decision, forcing disambiguation.
      In LLMs, this can be related to how beam search explores multiple token sequences before settling on one.
