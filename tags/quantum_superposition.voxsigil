principle: Emulates quantum-like cognitive superposition, allowing the system to hold
  and explore multiple, potentially contradictory, truths or states in parallel until
  a decision point (e.g., output tokenization) forces a 'collapse' to a single, definite
  state.
math: 'Let Î¨(x) represent the cognitive state concerning x.

  Î¨(x) = Î£áµ¢ cáµ¢|stateáµ¢âŸ©, where |stateáµ¢âŸ© are orthonormal basis states (e.g., alternative
  interpretations, hypotheses) and cáµ¢ are complex amplitudes.

  Probability of collapsing to stateâ‚–: P(stateâ‚–) = |câ‚–|Â².

  Normalization: Î£áµ¢ |cáµ¢|Â² = 1.

  Collapse is triggered at a decision threshold or decoding step, selecting one state
  based on these probabilities or a heuristic (e.g., highest probability in beam search).'

usage:
  description: Introduces deliberate ambiguity or forks cognitive logic to explore
    multiple pathways or interpretations simultaneously until one answer or perspective
    dominates or is selected, often analogous to a collapse in beam search.
  example:
    invocation_tag: <quantum:superposition states=['The artifact is a genuine relic',
      'The artifact is an elaborate hoax'] collapse_trigger='evidence_evaluation_complete'>
    scenario: An AI is analyzing a controversial artifact. It maintains both possibilities
      ('relic', 'hoax') in superposition, gathering and weighing evidence for each.
      Upon completing evidence evaluation, it collapses to the most probable state.
    expected_output_after_collapse: 'Collapsed state: ''The artifact is an elaborate
      hoax''. Supporting rationale: [summary of strongest evidence for hoax].'
  explanation: This sigil allows an LLM or cognitive system to hold multiple perspectives,
    hypotheses, or contradictory ideas simultaneously, much like a quantum system
    exists in a superposition of states. This is useful for tasks involving paradoxes,
    generating dual narratives, speculative reasoning, or exploring complex scenarios
    with inherent uncertainty. The 'collapse' occurs when the system needs to produce
    a definite output or make a decision, forcing disambiguation. In LLMs, this can
    be related to how beam search explores multiple token sequences before settling
    on one.
activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Encountering paradoxical or ambiguous information.
  - Need to generate multiple creative options or narratives.
  - Requirement for speculative reasoning under uncertainty.
  - Optimizing diverse outputs in a generative process (e.g., beam search).
  preconditions:
  - System can represent and process multiple distinct states in parallel or pseudo-parallel.
  - A mechanism for 'collapse' or state selection is defined.
  - Metrics for evaluating or weighting states (amplitudes) are available.

  - decision_threshold_logic
  - beam_search_like_decoding (for LLMs)
  supported_modalities:

  - programmatic_api
  contraindications:
  - A single, definite answer is immediately required without exploration.
  - Computational resources for parallel exploration are insufficient.
  - The problem space is not amenable to multiple valid interpretations.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Maintain and process multiple, potentially contradictory, cognitive states
    or ideas in a simulated superposition until a decision point forces collapse to
    a single state.
  Measurable: Increase in beam diversity during generation by at least 35%; increase
    in output entropy score by at least 12% prior to collapse, compared to non-superposition
    generation. Number of distinct states actively tracked.
  Achievable: Through managing multiple parallel token generation branches (e.g.,
    in beam search), each representing a state, followed by a reranking or selection
    mechanism for collapse. Can be simulated by maintaining distinct contexts.
  Relevant: Crucial for handling paradox prompts, generating dual or multiple narratives,
    speculative reasoning under uncertainty, and enhancing creative exploration by
    deferring commitment.
  Transferable: Experimental concept, but adaptable to LLMs with beam-search capabilities
    or those that can manage multiple independent generation contexts. The core idea
    can be simulated in various architectures.
