  principle: Directed Graph Navigation of Conceptual Domains Based on topological optimization and semantic routing. The aim
    is to find the most coherent and efficient cognitive path between two or more symbolic points in a conceptual space.
  math: 'Given a graph G = (V, E) where V is a set of concepts (vertices) and E is a set of relationships (edges) with associated
    weights w(e) representing semantic distance or transition cost.

    route(concept_start, concept_end) = P_min | P = (v_0, v_1, ..., v_k) such that v_0 = concept_start, v_k = concept_end,
    and (v_i, v_{i+1}) ∈ E for all 0 ≤ i < k. Cost(P) = Σ w(v_i, v_{i+1}). The objective is to find P_min that minimizes Cost(P).'

      invocation: <route:crossmap from='rationality' to='compassion' via_context='ethical_decision_making'>
      scenario_description: An AI is asked to explain how one might bridge the concepts of 'rationality' and 'compassion'
        when making an ethical decision. The system uses RouteCrossmap to generate a reasoned pathway.
      expected_output_snippet: 'Path: Rationality → (via cost-benefit analysis) → Understanding Consequences → (via empathy
        bridge) → Perspective Taking → (via value alignment) → Compassion. Rationale: Ethical decisions require both logical
        assessment of outcomes and empathetic understanding of impact.'
    explanation: Models reasoning, explanation generation, or conceptual exploration as a pathfinding task in a symbolic or
      semantic space. It allows for bridging disparate concepts, outlining arguments, exploring related topics, or even shifting
      emotional tones in a structured manner. Edge weights can be dynamic, based on context, semantic similarity, logical
      entailment, or learned associations.
