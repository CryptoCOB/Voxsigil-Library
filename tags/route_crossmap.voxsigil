principle: Directed Graph Navigation of Conceptual Domains Based on topological optimization
  and semantic routing. The aim is to find the most coherent and efficient cognitive
  path between two or more symbolic points in a conceptual space.
math: 'Given a graph G = (V, E) where V is a set of concepts (vertices) and E is a
  set of relationships (edges) with associated weights w(e) representing semantic
  distance or transition cost.

  route(concept_start, concept_end) = P_min | P = (v_0, v_1, ..., v_k) such that v_0
  = concept_start, v_k = concept_end, and (v_i, v_{i+1}) ‚àà E for all 0 ‚â§ i < k. Cost(P)
  = Œ£ w(v_i, v_{i+1}). The objective is to find P_min that minimizes Cost(P).'

  example:
    invocation: <route:crossmap from='rationality' to='compassion' via_context='ethical_decision_making'>
    scenario_description: An AI is asked to explain how one might bridge the concepts
      of 'rationality' and 'compassion' when making an ethical decision. The system
      uses RouteCrossmap to generate a reasoned pathway.
    expected_output_snippet: 'Path: Rationality ‚Üí (via cost-benefit analysis) ‚Üí Understanding
      Consequences ‚Üí (via empathy bridge) ‚Üí Perspective Taking ‚Üí (via value alignment)
      ‚Üí Compassion. Rationale: Ethical decisions require both logical assessment of
      outcomes and empathetic understanding of impact.'
  explanation: Models reasoning, explanation generation, or conceptual exploration
    as a pathfinding task in a symbolic or semantic space. It allows for bridging
    disparate concepts, outlining arguments, exploring related topics, or even shifting
    emotional tones in a structured manner. Edge weights can be dynamic, based on
    context, semantic similarity, logical entailment, or learned associations.
activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Need to generate an explanation bridging two concepts.
  - Requirement for a structured argument or narrative flow.
  - Exploration of conceptual relationships.
  - Task requires transforming one mental state/concept to another.
  - Planning a sequence of cognitive operations.
  preconditions:
  - A traversable conceptual graph or semantic space is accessible.
  - Start and end concepts (or symbolic states) are defined.
  - A method for evaluating path cost or transition coherence exists.
  required_capabilities:
  - graph_representation_access
  - pathfinding_algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra, beam search)
  - semantic_similarity_assessment (for edge weighting or heuristic)
  - symbolic_manipulation
  supported_modalities:
  - symbolic_input
  - textual
  - programmatic_api
  contraindications:
  - Concepts are entirely unrelated with no conceivable bridge in the current knowledge
    graph.
  - The conceptual space is too sparse or disconnected.
  - The computational cost of pathfinding is prohibitive for the given graph size
    and constraints.

  notes: The prompt encourages the LLM to simulate pathfinding and explain its reasoning.
    For actual graph traversal, this would often be an algorithmic process where the
    LLM might be used to evaluate semantic distances or generate rationales for algorithmically
    chosen steps.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Constructs an optimal or highly coherent cognitive route through a symbolic
    or semantic terrain (conceptual graph) between specified start and end concepts.
  Measurable: Path token cost, number of steps, or a semantic coherence score can
    be tracked. Link efficiency scored based on predefined metrics or human evaluation
    of relevance.
  Achievable: Using standard graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*) on
    a concept graph, where edge weights can be pre-defined or dynamically calculated
    (e.g., by an LLM estimating semantic distance). Priority queues manage concept
    exploration.
  Relevant: Crucial for contextual navigation in knowledge bases, generating coherent
    explanations, performing analogical reasoning, and constructing structured prompts
    or arguments.
  Transferable: The core logic is portable to any system with graph-aware capabilities,
    including LLMs augmented with knowledge graphs, vector databases with relationship
    information, or dedicated graph processing engines.
