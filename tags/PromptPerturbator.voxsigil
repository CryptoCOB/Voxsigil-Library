principle: Injects controlled creative perturbation or divergence into prompts or
  cognitive states by subtly shifting semantic vectors, introducing noise, synonyms,
  or conceptual inversions, aiming to stimulate novel outputs, explore alternative
  solution paths, or diagnose error sensitivities.
math: 'Let P be a prompt represented as a vector p in a semantic space. Mutate(p,
  σ²) → p'' where p'' = p + ε, and ε is a perturbation vector sampled from a distribution
  with variance σ² (strength). Alternatively, transformation T: P → P'' where T can
  be synonym_replacement(P, rate), concept_inversion(P, target), add_random_related_token(P).'

usage:
  description: Intentionally introduces small, controlled changes or 'mutations' to
    a given prompt or internal representation to encourage creative divergence, break
    out of repetitive loops, or test system robustness.
  example:
    original_prompt: Write a story about a brave knight.
    invocation_tag: '<deviate:mutation strength=0.3 mutation_type=''adjective_synonym_shift''>Original:
      ''Write a story about a brave knight.'' </deviate:mutation>'
    potential_mutated_prompt: 'Mutated Prompt: ''Write a story about a courageous
      paladin.'' or ''Write a story about a valiant hero.'' or ''Write a story about
      an audacious warrior.'''
  explanation: This sigil is used to spark creativity or explore the solution space
    more broadly. By slightly altering the input ('shifting the semantic vector'),
    it can lead the AI to generate different, potentially more innovative responses
    than it would with the canonical prompt. It's also useful for 'what-if' scenarios
    or diagnosing why a particular prompt might be failing by testing variations.
    The 'noise + synonym + inversion' are examples of mutation techniques.
activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Creative brainstorming sessions.
  - Need to overcome repetitive or stereotypical AI outputs.
  - Exploring alternative phrasings or conceptual approaches.
  - Diagnosing sensitivity of AI responses to prompt variations.
  - Generating diverse datasets from a seed prompt.
  preconditions:
  - A base prompt or cognitive state to mutate.
  - Defined mutation operators (e.g., synonym lists, noise functions, conceptual ontologies
    for shifts).
  required_capabilities:
  - semantic_representation_access
  - lexical_knowledge (for synonyms, antonyms)

  - symbolic_representation_mutation
  contraindications:
  - When precise, unvarying adherence to the original instruction is critical.
  - High-stakes situations where unpredictable deviations are unacceptable without
    explicit safety checks.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Shift the semantic vector or structure of a given prompt by a controlled
    amount (strength σ²) to inject creative perturbation, using techniques like noise
    addition, synonym replacement, or conceptual inversion.
  Measurable: Semantic distance (e.g., cosine distance in embedding space) between
    original and mutated prompt correlates with strength σ². Observable divergence
    from canonical AI response by X%. Increase in novelty/diversity scores of generated
    outputs.
  Achievable: By programmatically applying transformations to the prompt string (e.g.,
    replacing words with synonyms from a thesaurus, adding random noise to embeddings
    and finding nearest token, inverting sentiment markers) or by prompting an LLM
    to rephrase with specific constraints.
  Relevant: Useful for creative ideation, overcoming AI's tendency for stereotypical
    responses, exploring the boundaries of an AI's understanding, error diagnosis
    by observing sensitivity to small changes, and generating diverse training data.
  Transferable: Applicable to any model that accepts textual or symbolic prompts.
    Token rerouting or manipulation of internal representations can achieve this in
    more integrated systems. The concept is broadly adaptable.
