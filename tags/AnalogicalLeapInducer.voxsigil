principle: Facilitates the generation of novel and insightful analogies by bridging
  semantically distant conceptual domains, encouraging non-obvious connections and
  fostering creative problem-solving.
math: 'Given source concept S and target domain D_T. Maximize Novelty(A) * Usefulness(A)
  for analogy A: S → T'', where T'' ∈ D_T. Novelty may be inverse of semantic similarity(S,
  T'') within D_T, constrained by structural mapping consistency. Usefulness relates
  to explanatory power or problem-solving applicability.'

    description: Deconstructs the source concept into key attributes and relations.
  - name: TargetDomainSampler
    description: Selects candidate target domains, potentially biased towards novelty.
  - name: CrossDomainMapper
    description: Attempts to find structural or functional isomorphisms between source
      attributes and target domain elements.
  - name: AnalogyCandidateGenerator
    description: Constructs potential analogies based on mappings.
  - name: AnalogyEvaluator
    description: Scores analogies based on novelty, coherence, and potential usefulness.
usage:
  description: Prompts the system to make a 'leap' by finding an analogy from a specified
    source concept to a potentially unrelated target domain, or to find a surprising
    yet insightful analogy for a given concept.
  example:
    invocation: <AnalogicalLeapInducer source_concept='data_compression' target_domain_hint='biology'
      novelty_bias=0.8>
    potential_output: 'Analogy: Data compression is like DNA. Just as DNA compactly
      encodes vast biological information using a limited set of base pairs and structures,
      data compression uses algorithms to represent information efficiently with fewer
      bits, allowing for compact storage and transmission.'
  explanation: This sigil encourages 'thinking outside the box'. Instead of just finding
    close semantic neighbors, it pushes the system to explore more distant conceptual
    territories for analogical inspiration. This can be useful for brainstorming,
    explaining complex ideas in new ways, or sparking innovative solutions.

    Try to draw your analogy from an unexpected domain {{#if target_domain_hint}}(perhaps
    something related to '{{target_domain_hint}}'){{/if}}. Aim for a novelty bias
    of {{novelty_bias}} and ensure the analogy is insightful.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Generate novel and insightful analogies by bridging a source concept with
    elements from semantically distant or unexpected target domains.
  Measurable: Average semantic distance between source and target concepts in generated
    analogies. Human rating of analogy novelty and insightfulness (e.g., >3.5/5).
    Number of analogies generated passing a minimum coherence threshold.
  Achievable: By using embedding space exploration with a bias away from local clusters,
    combined with structural mapping algorithms and LLM-based evaluation for coherence
    and insight.
  Relevant: Crucial for fostering creativity, innovative problem-solving, effective
    communication of complex ideas, and breaking cognitive fixedness.
  Transferable: Applicable to any LLM or knowledge-based AI system with capabilities
    for semantic representation and reasoning. Core techniques can be adapted.
