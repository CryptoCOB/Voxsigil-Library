## Getting Started

1. Check system requirements with scripts in `scripts/`
2. Review documentation in `documentation/`
3. Run samples from `samples/` to test functionality
4. Use batch files in `batch_files/` for common operations

## Architecture

This project implements a modular AI system with multiple specialized agents,
reasoning capabilities, and a flexible plugin architecture.
