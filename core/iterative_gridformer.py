"""
Iterative GridFormer - Enhanced Grid Transformer with Iterative Reasoning

This module implements the Iterative GridFormer model, an enhanced version of the
base GridFormer that incorporates iterative reasoning capabilities. This allows
the model to refine its predictions through multiple reasoning steps.
