# --- Conceptual Grounding & Formalism ---
principle: |
  We orchestrate the final transformation of the VoxSigil Library from a tightly-coupled system 
  into a consciousness-ready, modular architecture capable of supporting Grid-Former training 
  for ARC tasks. Through systematic duplicate elimination, we establish Vanta as the central 
  orchestrator while maintaining experiential richness and evolutionary capabilities.
