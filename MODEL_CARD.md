### Computational Requirements

**Minimum Hardware**:
- GPU: 4GB VRAM (GTX 1660 Ti / RTX 2060 or equivalent)
- CPU: 4 cores, 2.5GHz+
- RAM: 8GB system memory
- Storage: 2GB for model weights

**Recommended Hardware**:
- GPU: 8GB+ VRAM (RTX 3070 / A4000 or better)
- CPU: 8+ cores, 3.0GHz+
- RAM: 16GB+ system memory
- Storage: 5GB for full installation

- CPU: 16+ cores
- RAM: 32GB+ system memory
- Storage: 10GB+ with fast SSD

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations

1. **Scale Dependency**: Performance degrades on grids larger than 30x30
2. **Temporal Reasoning**: Limited sequential pattern understanding
3. **Novel Concepts**: Struggles with completely unprecedented rule types
4. **Resource Intensive**: Requires significant computational resources
5. **Cold Start**: Initial inference slower due to ensemble initialization

### Bias and Fairness

1. **Training Data Bias**: Inherits biases from ARC dataset construction
2. **Geometric Bias**: Better performance on geometric vs. abstract patterns
3. **Cultural Neutrality**: ARC tasks designed to be culturally neutral
4. **No Human Demographic Data**: System doesn't process personal information

### Safety Considerations

1. **Adversarial Inputs**: May produce unexpected outputs on malformed inputs
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Complex tasks can consume significant GPU memory
3. **Reasoning Opacity**: Despite explainability features, some decisions remain opaque
4. **Model Drift**: Performance may degrade over time without monitoring

## Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Use

**Appropriate Uses**:
- Academic research and education
- Benchmarking and evaluation studies
- Development of reasoning systems
- AI safety and explainability research

**Inappropriate Uses**:
- Decision-making in critical systems (medical, financial, legal) without human oversight
- Automated content generation without verification
- Real-world deployment without proper testing and validation
- Use in systems that could cause harm without appropriate safeguards

### Data Privacy

- **No Personal Data**: System does not process or store personal information
- **Reasoning Traces**: Captured traces contain task data only, no user data
- **Telemetry**: Optional monitoring collects only system performance metrics
- **Audit Compliance**: Full reasoning traces support accountability requirements
