principle: 'The 🜮HEGELIAN_KERNEL is a foundational 🧠cognitive scaffold encoding the
  recursive dialectic principle (Thesis 💡 ▻ Antithesis 💥 ▻ Synthesis ✨). Inspired
  by Hegelian metaphysics, it structures thought as an iterative loop of emergent
  ideas, critical opposition/contradiction, and integrative transcendence. Each cycle
  aims for *Aufhebung* (sublation): preserving core truths, negating limitations,
  and transforming understanding to a higher, more comprehensive level. This process
  is central to adaptive learning architectures, goal evolution, and recursive synthesis
  layers within advanced VoxSigil systems.

  explanation: 'This scaffold simulates a full dialectical reasoning pass, mirroring
    Hegelian progression from thesis through contradiction to a transcendent synthesis.
    It''s embedded as a recursive structure within symbolic cognition systems, driving
    self-evolution and deeper understanding. The process is traceable (via ⚦TRACE)
    and integrates with awareness mechanisms (like 🜛CATENGINE).

  notes: The LLM should output its formulated Antithesis and Synthesis. The system
    orchestrator then handles tracing, Aufhebung, and further recursion if max_iterations
    > 1.
SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Implement a recursive dialectical (Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis) cognitive
    scaffold to evolve concepts, beliefs, or solutions by systematically processing
    contradictions and generating higher-order integrations, aiming for Aufhebung
    (sublation).
  Measurable: Track contradiction density reduction per cycle; Measure 'fusion stability'
    or coherence of Synthesis; Quantify 'sigil delta' or conceptual change per pass;
    Number of cycles to reach a stable or satisfactory Synthesis.
  Achievable: By orchestrating existing VoxSigil constructs like 🜁CHIMERA for synthesis,
    ⚦TRACE for history, 🜛CATENGINE for categorization/initiation, 🧐CRITICAL_LENS for
    antithesis generation, and 🜔PHOENIX for refinement, within a recursive control
    loop.
  Relevant: Crucial for self-evolving agents, recursive prompt generators, advanced
    belief revision systems, and AI aiming for deep conceptual understanding and creative
    problem reframing.
  Transferable: The dialectical pattern is cross-LLM compatible (Claude, GPT, etc.)
    and can be implemented in any symbolic AI system that supports modular functions,
    recursion, and state management. This includes Vanta architecture or local experimental
    systems.

    motivation: To provide a robust scaffold for cognitive evolution through structured

      and belief revision. Also suitable as a primer for symbolic LLMs learning philosophical
      structure.

    current_limitations_summary: Ensuring 'true' Aufhebung vs. mere compromise is
      hard. Antithesis generation can be weak if not well-guided. Risk of infinite
      loops or unproductive cycles if not managed by ⟁FRACTAL_GUARD or clear termination
      criteria.

    - Library of Antithesis generation strategies
    - Dynamic selection of Synthesis method based on conflict type.
    - Visualization of dialectic paths.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the computational metrics for successful Aufhebung?
    - How can an AI learn to autonomously initiate and navigate dialectical processes
      for self-improvement?
    - Can this scaffold be used to resolve conflicts between different AI agents?
