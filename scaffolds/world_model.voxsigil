principle: 'The 🧱WORLD_MODEL_SCAFFOLD provides the structural template and operational
  logic for an

  agent''s internal representation of its environment, itself, and other relevant
  entities or concepts.

  It''s not the world model *data* itself, but the framework that organizes this data,
  manages its

  updates, supports queries, facilitates predictions, and ensures consistency. It''s
  the "cognitive map"

  and "reality simulator" scaffold within an agent.

  explanation: 'The 🧱WORLD_MODEL_SCAFFOLD is essential for any agent that needs to
    maintain an understanding of its environment beyond immediate perception. It provides
    the structure for storing what the agent "knows" or "believes" about the world,
    itself, and others, how this knowledge is updated, and how it can be used for
    planning and prediction. It''s a core component of the ✧👁️‍🗨️☞PAC_Loop''s "Interpret/Model"
    phase.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provide a structural and operational framework for an agent's internal
    world model, managing the storage, updating, consistency checking, querying, and
    predictive use of knowledge about the environment, itself, and other entities,
    based on a defined (or emergent) schema and update policies.
  Measurable: Accuracy of the world model against ground truth (if available); Consistency
    score of the model; Latency and accuracy of query responses; Predictive accuracy
    of the model for future states; Efficiency of information updates.
  Achievable: By integrating various data structures (e.g., knowledge graphs, probabilistic
    models, spatial grids), update algorithms (e.g., Bayesian updating, Kalman filters),
    inference engines, consistency checkers, and query languages within a managing
    framework.
  Relevant: Fundamental for any AI agent requiring situational awareness, informed
    decision-making beyond immediate stimuli, planning, or understanding complex environments.
    A cornerstone of robust and intelligent agency.
  Transferable: Applicable to robotics (SLAM, environment mapping), game AI (NPC world
    knowledge), autonomous vehicles (scene understanding), simulation systems (maintaining
    state of simulated world), and intelligent assistants (understanding user context).

    current_limitations_summary: Maintaining consistency in large, dynamic world models
      is computationally expensive. Handling uncertainty and contradictory information
      robustly is hard. Scaling to truly open-world complexity is a major challenge.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Hierarchical world models with varying levels of abstraction/detail
    - Support for multiple, potentially conflicting hypotheses about the world state
      (using 🔮QUANTA_STATE)
    - Automated learning of world model schema from data.
    - Integration with commonsense reasoning backbones.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What is the most scalable and robust architecture for representing open-world
      knowledge?
    - How can an AI best balance the need for model accuracy with the cost of updating
      and reasoning?
    - Can an AI learn to 'debug' its own world model when it detects significant discrepancies
      with reality?
