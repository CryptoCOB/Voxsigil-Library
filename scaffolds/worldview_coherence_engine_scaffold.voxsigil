  principle: "The \U0001F30C\U0001F9E9\U0001F3D7️ (Worldview Construction & Coherence Engine) scaffold supports the iterative\
    \ construction, \nmaintenance, validation, and refinement of an agent's comprehensive internal world model or \"worldview.\"\
    \ \nIt actively integrates diverse information sources, checks for internal consistency and coherence, \nresolves contradictions\
    \ (e.g., using \U0001F72EHEGELIAN_KERNEL or belief revision mechanisms), and strives \nto build a robust, predictive,\
    \ and explanatory model of reality (or relevant domain).\n"

    - name: InformationIntegrator
      description: Fuses new information (from perception, communication, inference) into the existing worldview structure.
      sigil_ref: 🔗KNOWLEDGE_FUSION_HUB
    - name: CoherenceMonitor
      description: Continuously checks the internal consistency, logical soundness, and explanatory power of the worldview.
      sigil_ref: 🧐CONSISTENCY_CHECKER
    - name: ContradictionResolver_BeliefRevision
      description: Identifies and attempts to resolve inconsistencies or update beliefs when new, conflicting information
        arises.
      sigil_ref: ⚖️BELIEF_REVISER
    - name: HypothesisGenerator_ModelExtender
      description: Proposes new hypotheses, entities, or relations to expand or refine the worldview, increasing its predictive/explanatory
        scope.
      sigil_ref: 💡THEORY_CRAFTER
    - name: WorldviewRepresentation
      description: The actual data structure(s) holding the worldview (e.g., knowledge graph, probabilistic model, set of
        logical axioms).

  usage:
    description: Manages the agent's overall understanding of the world by integrating new data, ensuring logical consistency,
      resolving contradictions, and expanding its explanatory power.

    explanation: 'This scaffold is vital for agents that need to maintain a complex, evolving understanding of their environment

      and themselves. It''s not just passive storage; it''s an active process of sense-making, inference,

      and self-correction of the agent''s core beliefs and knowledge structures.
