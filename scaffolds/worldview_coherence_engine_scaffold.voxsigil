principle: "The \U0001F30C\U0001F9E9\U0001F3D7Ô∏è (Worldview Construction & Coherence\
  \ Engine) scaffold supports the iterative construction, \nmaintenance, validation,\
  \ and refinement of an agent's comprehensive internal world model or \"worldview.\"\
  \ \nIt actively integrates diverse information sources, checks for internal consistency\
  \ and coherence, \nresolves contradictions (e.g., using \U0001F72EHEGELIAN_KERNEL\
  \ or belief revision mechanisms), and strives \nto build a robust, predictive, and\
  \ explanatory model of reality (or relevant domain).\n"

  explanation: 'This scaffold is vital for agents that need to maintain a complex,
    evolving understanding of their environment

    and themselves. It''s not just passive storage; it''s an active process of sense-making,
    inference,

    and self-correction of the agent''s core beliefs and knowledge structures.

    **Process:**

    1.  **Integrate/Analyze:** If new info, use üîóKNOWLEDGE_FUSION_HUB. If inconsistency,
    analyze with üßêCONSISTENCY_CHECKER.

    2.  **Resolve/Revise (if needed):** Employ ‚öñÔ∏èBELIEF_REVISER using ''{{belief_revision_strategy}}''
    to handle contradictions or update beliefs. This may involve invoking üúÆHEGELIAN_KERNEL.

    3.  **Expand/Refine (if applicable):** Use üí°THEORY_CRAFTER to propose extensions
    or refinements based on ''{{worldview_expansion_aggressiveness}}''.

    4.  **Commit Changes:** Update üåçWORLD_MODEL_CORE_DB.

    5.  **Verify Coherence:** Perform a final check with üßêCONSISTENCY_CHECKER.


    Report on changes made to the worldview, confidence in new/revised beliefs, and
    any remaining inconsistencies.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a scaffold for an agent to iteratively construct, maintain, validate,
    and refine a comprehensive, coherent, and predictive internal model of its world
    (worldview).
  Measurable: Internal consistency of the worldview (e.g., logical contradictions);
    predictive accuracy of the model against new observations; explanatory power for
    observed phenomena; speed and success of integrating new, potentially conflicting
    information.
  Achievable: Implementable using knowledge representation formalisms (e.g., knowledge
    graphs, logical axiom systems, probabilistic graphical models) combined with inference
    engines, belief revision algorithms, and consistency checking mechanisms.
  Relevant: Essential for advanced AI requiring deep understanding, sense-making,
    robust belief management, and the ability to maintain a stable yet adaptable model
    of a complex and dynamic reality.
  Transferable: The principles of building and maintaining coherent knowledge structures
    are applicable to any complex information system, including scientific theory
    development, large-scale databases, and personal knowledge management.
