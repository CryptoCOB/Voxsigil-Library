principle: "The \U0001F9E0\U0001F578Ô∏è\U0001F517 (Associative Memory Network Scaffold)\
  \ defines the architecture for a dynamic, associative memory system. \nIt enables\
  \ the storage, linking, and context-sensitive retrieval of diverse information types\
  \ (episodic, semantic, \nprocedural) based on relational strength, recency, relevance,\
  \ and emotional tagging, forming a rich, \ninterconnected knowledge web. It supports\
  \ not just recall but also inference and pattern completion across linked concepts.\n"

usage:
  description: Provides the foundational scaffold for an agent's long-term memory,
    supporting storage, rich association, contextual recall, and inference.
  example: "// Agent needs to recall information related to \"Project Chimera\" in\
    \ the context of \"ethical concerns\".\nretrieved_memories = AMN_SCAFFOLD.retrieve(\n\
    \    query_concepts=[\"Project Chimera\", \"ethics\"],\n    context_vector=\"\
    current_conversation_embedding\",\n    max_results=5,\n    retrieval_strategy=\"\
    spreading_activation_with_relevance_filter\"\n);\n"
  explanation: 'This scaffold is constantly active in an agent, encoding experiences
    and knowledge. It''s queried during

    problem-solving, conversation, planning, and self-reflection to provide relevant
    past information,

    contextualize current situations, and support complex reasoning by drawing on
    learned associations.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a dynamic, associative network for storing, linking, and retrieving
    diverse information types based on context, similarity, and learned associations,
    enabling rich memory functions.
  Measurable: Recall precision/recall on benchmark datasets; speed of retrieval; coherence
    of inferred relationships; ability to answer questions requiring multi-hop reasoning
    across memories.
  Achievable: Implementable using graph databases, vector embeddings with similarity
    search, neural associative memory models, or hybrid symbolic-connectionist approaches.
  Relevant: Essential for any intelligent system requiring long-term memory, learning
    from past experiences, contextual understanding, and the ability to make novel
    connections between disparate pieces of information.
  Transferable: The principles of associative memory are fundamental to human and
    artificial cognition and can be applied in various forms across different AI architectures
    and application domains.
