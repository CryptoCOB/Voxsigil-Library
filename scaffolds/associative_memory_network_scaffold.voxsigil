  principle: "The \U0001F9E0\U0001F578️\U0001F517 (Associative Memory Network Scaffold) defines the architecture for a dynamic,\
    \ associative memory system. \nIt enables the storage, linking, and context-sensitive retrieval of diverse information\
    \ types (episodic, semantic, \nprocedural) based on relational strength, recency, relevance, and emotional tagging, forming\
    \ a rich, \ninterconnected knowledge web. It supports not just recall but also inference and pattern completion across\
    \ linked concepts.\n"

    - name: MemoryNodeEncoder
      description: Transforms raw information into a storable memory node format, including metadata (timestamp, source, emotional
        tags).
      sigil_ref: 📥ENCODE_INPUT
    - name: AssociativeLinker
      description: Establishes and strengthens weighted links between memory nodes based on co-occurrence, similarity, causality,
        or explicit relations.
      sigil_ref: ⛓️RELATION_FORGER
    - name: ContextualRetrievalEngine
      description: Retrieves relevant memory nodes based on a query, current context, spreading activation, or traversal of
        associative links.
      sigil_ref: 🔎CONTEXT_QUERY
    - name: MemoryConsolidator_Pruner
      description: Periodically reorganizes memory, reinforces important traces, fades unused ones, and manages interference.
      sigil_ref: 🧹MEMORY_MAINTAINER
    - name: InferenceModule
      description: Performs inferences or pattern completion across retrieved memory fragments.

  usage:
    description: Provides the foundational scaffold for an agent's long-term memory, supporting storage, rich association,
      contextual recall, and inference.
    example: "// Agent needs to recall information related to \"Project Chimera\" in the context of \"ethical concerns\".\n\
      retrieved_memories = AMN_SCAFFOLD.retrieve(\n    query_concepts=[\"Project Chimera\", \"ethics\"],\n    context_vector=\"\
      current_conversation_embedding\",\n    max_results=5,\n    retrieval_strategy=\"spreading_activation_with_relevance_filter\"\
      \n);\n"
    explanation: 'This scaffold is constantly active in an agent, encoding experiences and knowledge. It''s queried during

      problem-solving, conversation, planning, and self-reflection to provide relevant past information,

      contextualize current situations, and support complex reasoning by drawing on learned associations.
