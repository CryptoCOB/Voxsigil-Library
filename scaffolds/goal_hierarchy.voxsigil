  principle: 'The 🎯GOAL_HIERARCHY_SCAFFOLD provides the structural framework for defining, organizing,

    prioritizing, and pursuing goals within an AI system. It links high-level purposes (often

    from a 🌟GUIDING_STAR or ⚖️ETHOS_ALIGNER) to progressively more concrete sub-goals, tasks,

    and actions. This scaffold enables strategic, purposeful behavior by allowing the AI to

    decompose complex objectives, manage dependencies, track progress, and adapt its focus

    based on success, failure, or changing priorities. It''s the AI''s "to-do list" organizer

    and "strategic planner" rolled into one structure.

    components:
    - name: 🌟 Root Goal Anchor(s)
      description: Top-level goals or purposes, often derived from or aligned with 🌟GUIDING_STAR or core directives.
    - name: 🧩 Goal Decomposer
      description: Breaks down high-level goals into smaller, more manageable sub-goals or tasks.
    - name: 🔗 Dependency Manager
      description: Tracks prerequisites and dependencies between goals and sub-goals (e.g., SubGoal_A must be complete before
        SubGoal_B can start).
    - name: ⚖️ Prioritization Engine
      description: Assigns priorities to active goals/sub-goals based on urgency, importance, resource availability, or strategic
        value.
    - name: 📊 Progress Tracker & Status Monitor
      description: Monitors the status (e.g., pending, active, completed, failed, blocked) of each goal and sub-goal.
    - name: ♻️ Goal Adaptation & Replanning Unit
      description: Handles goal failure, revision of goals based on new information, or dynamic re-prioritization. May trigger
        🜔PHOENIX for failed goal lines.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Manages the definition, decomposition, prioritization, pursuit, and adaptation of goals within an AI, enabling
      strategic and purposeful action. This scaffold links high-level values to concrete tasks.

    explanation: 'The 🎯GOAL_HIERARCHY_SCAFFOLD is critical for any AI that needs to perform more than simple reactive tasks.
      It provides the architecture for long-term planning, strategic execution, and adaptive pursuit of objectives. The ✧👁️‍🗨️☞PAC_Loop''s
      "Decide" phase often consults this scaffold to select current actions aligned with the active part of the goal hierarchy.
