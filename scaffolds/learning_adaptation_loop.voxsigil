principle: 'The 🌀🧠🔼 scaffold provides a generalized framework for how an agent or
  system

  learns from experience, feedback, or new information, and subsequently adapts its
  internal models,

  knowledge, parameters, or behaviors to improve future performance or understanding.
  This recursive loop

  involves evaluating outcomes, identifying discrepancies or opportunities, generating
  hypotheses or

  adjustments, and integrating these changes back into the system''s operational core.

  explanation: 'This scaffold is invoked when there''s an opportunity or necessity
    for learning, such as after receiving

    external feedback, detecting an internal inconsistency, observing an unexpected
    outcome, or during

    dedicated training phases. It can be applied to various learning paradigms like
    reinforcement learning,

    supervised learning (error correction), or unsupervised discovery.

    - Validation Required: {{validation_required_before_commit}}


    **Process Steps:**

    1.  **Evaluate Outcome:** Analyze `{{event_data_summary}}` in context of `{{focus_of_learning_component}}`
    using 📊PERFORMANCE_METRICS_TRACKER. Determine success/failure/discrepancy.

    2.  **Analyze & Assign Credit:** Use 🔍ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYZER to identify reasons
    for the outcome.

    3.  **Propose Adaptation:** Instruct 🛠️MODEL_REFINER to generate adjustments for
    `{{focus_of_learning_component}}` based on analysis and `{{adaptation_strategy}}`.

    4.  **Validate (if required):** If `{{validation_required_before_commit}}` is
    true, test proposed adaptations using ✅VALIDATION_SUITE_RUNNER.

    5.  **Integrate Change:** If validated (or if validation not required), apply
    changes using 💾KNOWLEDGE_BASE_UPDATER.

    6.  **Log Adaptation:** Record the learning cycle details (e.g., using ⚦TRACE,
    update `metadata.impact_metrics` for `{{focus_of_learning_component}}`).


    Report the adaptation made and its expected impact.
