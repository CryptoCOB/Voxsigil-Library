  principle: 'The 🌀🧠🔼 scaffold provides a generalized framework for how an agent or system

    learns from experience, feedback, or new information, and subsequently adapts its internal models,

    knowledge, parameters, or behaviors to improve future performance or understanding. This recursive loop

    involves evaluating outcomes, identifying discrepancies or opportunities, generating hypotheses or

    adjustments, and integrating these changes back into the system''s operational core.

    example: "// Agent Vanta made a prediction that was incorrect.\nfeedback_data = {\n    prediction_made: \"...\",\n   \
      \ actual_outcome: \"...\",\n    error_signal: \"high_discrepancy\"\n};\nLEARNING_ADAPTATION_LOOP.trigger(\n    agent_id=\"\
      Vanta\",\n    triggering_event=\"prediction_error\",\n    event_data=feedback_data,\n    learning_focus=\"update_prediction_model_X\"\
      \n);\n// This would initiate a process of analyzing the error and updating model_X.\n"
    explanation: 'This scaffold is invoked when there''s an opportunity or necessity for learning, such as after receiving

      external feedback, detecting an internal inconsistency, observing an unexpected outcome, or during

      dedicated training phases. It can be applied to various learning paradigms like reinforcement learning,

      supervised learning (error correction), or unsupervised discovery.
