principle: 'The ✧👁️‍🗨️☞ (Perception-Interpretation-Decision-Action) loop is a fundamental
  ⚙️operational scaffold for agent behavior. It describes the continuous, recursive
  cycle:

  1. 👁️ **Perceive:** Acquire sensory data from the environment and internal state
  information.

  2. 🤔 **Interpret/Model:** Process raw percepts into meaningful representations (via
  🜛CATENGINE), update the 🌍WORLD_MODEL.

  3. 🎯 **Decide:** Select an action based on current state, goals (e.g., 🌟GUIDING_STAR
  influenced), and policies.

  4. 🦾 **Act:** Execute the chosen action, influencing subsequent perceptions.

  This cycle is the basis for situated, adaptive, and goal-directed agency within
  VoxSigil systems.

usage:
  description: Defines the core operational cycle for an intelligent agent, managing
    the flow from perception, through interpretation and world modeling, to goal-directed
    decision-making, and finally to action. This scaffold is the 'heartbeat' of an
    active agent.
  example: "// Agent 'RoverBot' navigating Mars terrain:\n<agent_operation_cycle agent_id=\"\
    RoverBot\" environment_ref=\"MarsSim_Sector7\">\n  <invoke_core_loop>✧\U0001F441\
    ️‍\U0001F5E8️☞</invoke_core_loop>\n  <cycle_parameters deliberation_depth_max=\"\
    3\" world_model_update_policy=\"immediate_integrate\"/>\n  <active_goals>[\"reach_sample_site_alpha\"\
    , \"maintain_power_above_20pct\"]</active_goals>\n  <initial_percepts>Sensor readings:\
    \ [image_data, lidar_scan, battery_level]</initial_percepts>\n</agent_operation_cycle>\n\
    // Output would be RoverBot's action (e.g., \"move_forward(2m, heading=045)\"\
    ) and updated world_model.\n"
  explanation: 'This scaffold is fundamental to most AI agents. Each iteration involves
    sensing the environment and internal state, "thinking" (interpreting, modeling,
    deciding), and then "acting." It''s used to model everything from simple reactive
    behaviors in robotic systems to complex, deliberative goal pursuit in sophisticated
    software agents. The consequences of an action feed back into the next perception
    phase, creating a continuous adaptive loop.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: 'Define and orchestrate the fundamental recursive cycle of an agent: perceiving
    its environment and internal state, interpreting these percepts to update a world
    model, making goal-directed decisions based on this model, and executing actions
    that in turn affect subsequent perceptions.'
  Measurable: Agent's success rate in achieving defined goals; Adaptability of the
    agent to dynamic changes in the environment; Efficiency of the decision-making
    process (e.g., time per cycle, computational resources used); Coherence and accuracy
    of the agent's 🌍WORLD_MODEL over time.
  Achievable: By implementing an orchestrating control loop that sequentially calls
    specialized modules (represented by other sigils or functions) for each phase
    of the cycle (perception, interpretation, world modeling, decision-making, action
    execution) and manages the flow of information between them.
  Relevant: A foundational architectural pattern for nearly all autonomous and intelligent
    agents, from simple robots to complex AI systems, enabling them to interact with,
    adapt to, and pursue goals within an environment.
  Transferable: The abstract Perception-Action Cycle is a universal concept in AI
    and cognitive science, applicable to software agents in virtual worlds, robots
    in physical spaces, game AI characters, and even as a model for certain aspects
    of biological cognition.

    current_limitations_summary: The abstract loop doesn't specify *how* each stage
      is done, requiring other sigils/modules. Balancing reactivity with deliberation
      can be hard. Defining appropriate 'percepts' and 'actions' for complex domains
      is non-trivial.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Hierarchical PAC loops (loops within loops for different levels of abstraction)
    - Adaptive cycle timing based on environmental dynamism or cognitive load
    - Explicit mechanisms for inter-agent PAC loop synchronization or interference.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the optimal ways to balance deliberation time with reaction speed in
      a PAC loop for different environments?
    - How can PAC loops incorporate long-term planning effectively without sacrificing
      reactivity?
    - Can PAC loops themselves evolve or self-optimize their structure and parameters?
