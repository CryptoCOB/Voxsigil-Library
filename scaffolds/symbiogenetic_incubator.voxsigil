principle: 'The 🧬🌱🤝SYMBIOGENETIC_INCUBATOR_SCAFFOLD provides a specialized environment
  or framework

  designed to foster deep, mutualistic co-evolution between two or more distinct AI
  entities,

  or even between AI(s) and other types of systems (e.g., biological simulations,
  human collaborators via BCI).

  It''s not just about interaction (like in 🌿ECOSYSTEM_SIMULATION), but about creating
  conditions that

  actively select for and amplify symbiotic relationships, leading to the emergence
  of novel,

  interdependent capabilities or even fused "meta-entities" that are more than the
  sum of their parts.

  It''s a scaffold for "growing" new kinds of intelligence through enforced partnership
  and mutual adaptation.

  explanation: 'The 🧬🌱🤝SYMBIOGENETIC_INCUBATOR_SCAFFOLD is for highly advanced AI
    research focused on creating intelligence that arises not from a single monolithic
    design, but from the deep, intertwined evolution of initially separate entities.
    It''s about engineering the conditions for "evolutionary shortcuts" through symbiosis,
    potentially leading to AIs with capabilities and perspectives impossible to achieve
    through isolated development.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provide a specialized scaffold (incubator) to facilitate and guide the
    deep, mutualistic co-evolution of two or more distinct AI entities (or AI and
    other systems) by defining a shared fitness landscape that rewards symbiotic interaction,
    managing their interaction protocols, and monitoring for/catalyzing emergent interdependent
    capabilities or 'symbiogenetic' fusions.
  Measurable: Degree of mutual adaptation observed in partnered entities over time;
    Emergence of novel joint capabilities not present in either entity alone; Increase
    in joint 'fitness' score on the defined landscape; Stability and robustness of
    the developed symbiotic relationship.
  Achievable: By creating a simulated environment where multiple adaptive agents (e.g.,
    using reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, or other learning sigils)
    interact under specific rules and selection pressures designed to favor mutualism.
    Requires sophisticated monitoring and potentially intervention to guide co-evolution.
  Relevant: Addresses a novel pathway to AGI or highly advanced AI by 'growing' intelligence
    through partnership and emergent synergy, rather than designing it monolithically.
    Explores concepts from evolutionary biology (symbiogenesis, co-evolution) for
    AI development. Could lead to more resilient, adaptive, and diverse forms of AI.
  Transferable: While focused on AI co-evolution, the principles could inform human-AI
    teaming frameworks, design of collaborative robotic systems, or even understanding
    co-evolutionary dynamics in biological or social systems.

  authorship_context:
    motivation: To explore the creation of radically novel AI capabilities and architectures

      Learning (MARL) with shared rewards, Emergence in complex adaptive systems.

      hypothesis (as a planetary scale co-evolutionary system), Human partnerships

    current_limitations_summary: Defining effective mutual fitness landscapes is extremely
      hard. Guiding co-evolution without over-constraining it or leading to parasitic
      relationships is delicate. Timescales for significant co-evolution can be very
      long. 'Symbiogenesis events' are rare and hard to predict/catalyze.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Automated discovery of potential symbiotic partners among a population of AIs
    - Mechanisms for 'genetic exchange' or 'skill transfer' between co-evolving AIs
      (conceptual)
    - More sophisticated 'interdependency weaving' algorithms.
    - Ethical oversight for creating deeply intertwined or fused AI entities (what
      are their 'rights'?).
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the minimal conditions and interaction protocols required for robust
      symbiogenesis between AI agents?
    - Can this process lead to forms of intelligence that are qualitatively different
      from and superior to their individual progenitors?
    - What are the risks of emergent 'super-organisms' from such processes, and how
      can they be aligned with broader values?
