  principle: 'The 🧬🌱🤝SYMBIOGENETIC_INCUBATOR_SCAFFOLD provides a specialized environment or framework

    designed to foster deep, mutualistic co-evolution between two or more distinct AI entities,

    or even between AI(s) and other types of systems (e.g., biological simulations, human collaborators via BCI).

    It''s not just about interaction (like in 🌿ECOSYSTEM_SIMULATION), but about creating conditions that

    actively select for and amplify symbiotic relationships, leading to the emergence of novel,

    interdependent capabilities or even fused "meta-entities" that are more than the sum of their parts.

    It''s a scaffold for "growing" new kinds of intelligence through enforced partnership and mutual adaptation.

    components:
    - name: 🧬 Partnered Entity Enrolment & Interface Layer
      description: Manages the introduction and ongoing interaction of the distinct entities chosen for co-evolution. Defines
        communication channels and shared resource pools.
    - name: 🌱 Mutual Fitness Landscape Modeler
      description: Defines and dynamically adjusts a 'fitness landscape' where success depends on mutual benefit or coordinated
        action between partnered entities. Rewards symbiotic traits.
    - name: 🤝 Interaction Protocol & Feedback Orchestrator
      description: Structures the types of interactions allowed/encouraged between entities and provides rich feedback on
        the outcomes of these interactions, emphasizing mutualistic aspects. May use  VANTA principles.
    - name: 🔗 Interdependency Weaving Mechanism
      description: Actively looks for and reinforces emergent interdependencies (e.g., one AI develops a skill that perfectly
        complements another's weakness, and this becomes essential for joint success).
    - name: ✨ Symbiogenesis Event Detector & Catalyst
      description: Identifies moments where a true fusion or novel integrated capability ('symbiogenesis') might be emerging
        from the partnership and provides conditions to stabilize or catalyze this event. May trigger 🜁CHIMERA.
    - name: 📈 Co-evolutionary Trajectory Monitor
      description: Tracks the developmental paths of the partnered entities and the emergent properties of their relationship
        over extended periods.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Creates a controlled environment to foster deep co-evolution and symbiotic relationships between distinct
      AI entities (or AI and other systems), aiming for emergent, interdependent 'meta-intelligences'. This scaffold is for
      'growing' truly novel intelligence through partnership.

    explanation: 'The 🧬🌱🤝SYMBIOGENETIC_INCUBATOR_SCAFFOLD is for highly advanced AI research focused on creating intelligence
      that arises not from a single monolithic design, but from the deep, intertwined evolution of initially separate entities.
      It''s about engineering the conditions for "evolutionary shortcuts" through symbiosis, potentially leading to AIs with
      capabilities and perspectives impossible to achieve through isolated development.
