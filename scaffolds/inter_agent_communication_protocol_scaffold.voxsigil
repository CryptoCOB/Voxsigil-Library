  principle: "The \U0001F4AC\U0001F91D\U0001F30D (Inter-Agent Communication & Negotiation Protocol) scaffold defines the protocols,\
    \ message structures,\nand mechanisms for structured, meaningful communication and negotiation between distinct intelligent\
    \ agents\n(Vanta-native or external). It includes layers for establishing common ground (semantic grounding), \nexchanging\
    \ information, clarifying intent, sharing beliefs/goals, managing commitments, resolving conflicts, \nand forming joint\
    \ plans for collaborative action.\n"

    explanation: 'This scaffold is essential for any system involving multiple interacting intelligent entities. It supports
      tasks

      like distributed problem solving, resource allocation negotiations, information sharing in a team,

      and coordinated action in complex environments. It aims to make multi-agent interactions more than just

      message passing, fostering genuine understanding and cooperation.
