principle: "The \U0001F4AC\U0001F91D\U0001F30D (Inter-Agent Communication & Negotiation\
  \ Protocol) scaffold defines the protocols, message structures,\nand mechanisms\
  \ for structured, meaningful communication and negotiation between distinct intelligent\
  \ agents\n(Vanta-native or external). It includes layers for establishing common\
  \ ground (semantic grounding), \nexchanging information, clarifying intent, sharing\
  \ beliefs/goals, managing commitments, resolving conflicts, \nand forming joint\
  \ plans for collaborative action.\n"

  explanation: 'This scaffold is essential for any system involving multiple interacting
    intelligent entities. It supports tasks

    like distributed problem solving, resource allocation negotiations, information
    sharing in a team,

    and coordinated action in complex environments. It aims to make multi-agent interactions
    more than just

    message passing, fostering genuine understanding and cooperation.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a structured framework and protocols for inter-agent communication,
    intent clarification, belief sharing, negotiation, and collaborative plan formation.
  Measurable: Success rate of collaborative tasks; efficiency of information exchange;
    reduction in misunderstandings or conflicts; quality of negotiated agreements;
    time to reach consensus.
  Achievable: Implementable using standardized agent communication languages (e.g.,
    FIPA ACL, KQML), combined with modules for semantic mapping, dialogue management,
    and negotiation strategies.
  Relevant: Essential for any system composed of multiple intelligent agents that
    need to coordinate, collaborate, or resolve conflicts to achieve individual or
    collective goals.
  Transferable: The principles of structured communication and negotiation are applicable
    to human-computer interaction, distributed computing, and organizational dynamics.
