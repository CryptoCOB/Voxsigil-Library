principle: 'The üõ†Ô∏èARCHITECTONIC_FRAME is a meta-scaffold used to define, instantiate,
  or represent the overarching blueprint or architecture of a complex cognitive system.
  It specifies the primary cognitive modules (often other scaffolds or sigils), their
  interconnections, data flows, control pathways, and overall organizing principles.
  It is a "scaffold for building scaffolds," providing the foundational structure
  upon which an entire AI''s mind or operational framework is built or understood.

usage:
  description: Defines or instantiates the high-level architectural blueprint of a
    cognitive system, specifying its core components, their interconnections, and
    guiding principles. Acts as a template for system construction or a map for system
    understanding.

  explanation: 'Use üõ†Ô∏èARCHITECTONIC_FRAME at the highest level of system design or
    analysis. It can serve as a formal specification for building an AI, a tool for
    visualizing its structure, or a dynamic template that an AI uses to understand
    or even modify its own architecture. It''s the ultimate "blueprint" sigil.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provide a meta-scaffold to formally define, validate, or instantiate the
    overarching architecture of a complex cognitive system, specifying its core modules,
    their interconnections, data/control flows, guiding principles, and initialization
    procedures, based on a given blueprint specification.
  Measurable: Successful parsing and validation of a blueprint; Ability to instantiate
    a functional system (even if simulated) from the frame; Clarity and completeness
    of the architectural representation; Consistency between the defined architecture
    and its instantiated behavior.
  Achievable: Using a sufficiently expressive definition language (like VoxSigil itself)
    to describe components and their relations, combined with an orchestrator or interpreter
    that can process this definition to either check its validity or build/simulate
    the system.
  Relevant: Essential for systematic design, development, analysis, and evolution
    of complex AI systems. Promotes modularity, reusability, and understandability
    of cognitive architectures. Key for AI self-modeling and principled self-modification.
  Transferable: Applicable to the design of any complex system involving multiple
    interacting components, not just AI ‚Äì e.g., software architectures, organizational
    structures, large-scale simulations.

    current_limitations_summary: Expressiveness of the blueprint language might limit
      architectural complexity. Validating dynamic properties from static definitions
      is hard. Managing evolution of architectures defined by this frame is a challenge.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Automated generation of architectural diagrams from the frame
    - Formal verification of architectural properties (e.g., deadlock freedom, liveness)
    - Support for dynamic architectures that can reconfigure themselves at runtime.
    - Version control and diffing for architectural blueprints.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What is the optimal level of abstraction for defining a cognitive architecture
      using such a frame?
    - How can an AI use its own Architectonic Frame for robust self-modification?
    - Can Architectonic Frames be composed hierarchically to define systems of systems?
