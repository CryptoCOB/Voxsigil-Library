principle: "The ⚜️✨\U0001F3A8 (Novelty Generation & Creative Synthesis Engine) scaffold\
  \ provides a framework specifically \nfor divergent thinking, creative ideation,\
  \ and the generation of truly novel concepts, solutions, or artistic \nexpressions\
  \ that go beyond simple recombination or standard dialectical synthesis. It incorporates\
  \ mechanisms for \nanalogy, abstraction, conceptual blending, bisociation, playful\
  \ exploration, curiosity-driven inquiry, and potentially \nserendipitous discovery\
  \ (e.g., via structured noise, interaction with dream-like states, or cross-domain\
  \ mapping). \nOutputs are often evaluated for originality, utility, and aesthetic\
  \ value.\n"

  explanation: 'This scaffold is invoked when the goal is not just problem-solving
    but true innovation or artistic creation.

    It moves beyond logical deduction or standard problem-solving heuristics to explore
    the "adjacent possible"

    and generate ideas that are surprising, original, and valuable. It''s key for
    tasks like design,

    scientific discovery, artistic composition, and strategic foresight.

    and other techniques from `{{creativity_heuristic_set}}` to generate initial novel
    ideas.

    3.  **Inject Serendipity (if enabled):** Use 🎲CURIOSITY_DICE to introduce unexpected
    elements or explore tangential paths.

    4.  **Iterate & Refine:** For `{{max_ideation_cycles}}` cycles, refine promising
    ideas, generate variations, and abstract common patterns.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a dedicated framework for generating novel and creative concepts,
    solutions, or artistic expressions through techniques like analogy, conceptual
    blending, abstraction, and serendipity enhancement.
  Measurable: Originality/novelty scores of generated outputs (e.g., via human rating
    or computational metrics); utility or applicability of creative solutions; diversity
    of generated ideas; successful application in creative domains (art, design, scientific
    hypothesis generation).
  Achievable: Implementable by orchestrating LLM calls with specialized prompting
    techniques for creative tasks, combined with algorithms for conceptual space traversal,
    analogical mapping, and evaluation heuristics for novelty/value.
  Relevant: Essential for AI systems aiming beyond rote problem-solving towards true
    innovation, artistic expression, and discovery. Addresses the need for AI to be
    not just analytical but also generative and imaginative.
  Transferable: The principles of creative cognition and novelty generation are applicable
    across many human and artificial domains, from product design and scientific research
    to storytelling and artistic endeavors.
