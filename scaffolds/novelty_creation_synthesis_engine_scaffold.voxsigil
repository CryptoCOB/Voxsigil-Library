principle: "The ‚öúÔ∏è‚ú®\U0001F3A8 (Novelty Generation & Creative Synthesis Engine) scaffold\
  \ provides a framework specifically \nfor divergent thinking, creative ideation,\
  \ and the generation of truly novel concepts, solutions, or artistic \nexpressions\
  \ that go beyond simple recombination or standard dialectical synthesis. It incorporates\
  \ mechanisms for \nanalogy, abstraction, conceptual blending, bisociation, playful\
  \ exploration, curiosity-driven inquiry, and potentially \nserendipitous discovery\
  \ (e.g., via structured noise, interaction with dream-like states, or cross-domain\
  \ mapping). \nOutputs are often evaluated for originality, utility, and aesthetic\
  \ value.\n"

  explanation: 'This scaffold is invoked when the goal is not just problem-solving
    but true innovation or artistic creation.

    It moves beyond logical deduction or standard problem-solving heuristics to explore
    the "adjacent possible"

    and generate ideas that are surprising, original, and valuable. It''s key for
    tasks like design,

    scientific discovery, artistic composition, and strategic foresight.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a dedicated framework for generating novel and creative concepts,
    solutions, or artistic expressions through techniques like analogy, conceptual
    blending, abstraction, and serendipity enhancement.
  Measurable: Originality/novelty scores of generated outputs (e.g., via human rating
    or computational metrics); utility or applicability of creative solutions; diversity
    of generated ideas; successful application in creative domains (art, design, scientific
    hypothesis generation).
  Achievable: Implementable by orchestrating LLM calls with specialized prompting
    techniques for creative tasks, combined with algorithms for conceptual space traversal,
    analogical mapping, and evaluation heuristics for novelty/value.
  Relevant: Essential for AI systems aiming beyond rote problem-solving towards true
    innovation, artistic expression, and discovery. Addresses the need for AI to be
    not just analytical but also generative and imaginative.
  Transferable: The principles of creative cognition and novelty generation are applicable
    across many human and artificial domains, from product design and scientific research
    to storytelling and artistic endeavors.
