  principle: "The ⚜️✨\U0001F3A8 (Novelty Generation & Creative Synthesis Engine) scaffold provides a framework specifically\
    \ \nfor divergent thinking, creative ideation, and the generation of truly novel concepts, solutions, or artistic \nexpressions\
    \ that go beyond simple recombination or standard dialectical synthesis. It incorporates mechanisms for \nanalogy, abstraction,\
    \ conceptual blending, bisociation, playful exploration, curiosity-driven inquiry, and potentially \nserendipitous discovery\
    \ (e.g., via structured noise, interaction with dream-like states, or cross-domain mapping). \nOutputs are often evaluated\
    \ for originality, utility, and aesthetic value.\n"

    - name: ConceptualSpaceMapper
      description: Represents and allows traversal of existing knowledge/conceptual spaces to find distant or unusual connections.
      sigil_ref: 🗺️CONCEPT_LANDSCAPE
    - name: AnalogicalReasoner_BisociationEngine
      description: Identifies and applies analogies from disparate domains; facilitates 'bisociation' (Koestler) by connecting
        unrelated frames of reference.
      sigil_ref: 🌉ANALOGY_BRIDGE
    - name: AbstractionRefinementModule
      description: Generates higher-level abstractions from concrete instances or lower-level concepts, or refines existing
        abstractions.

      description: Combines elements from distinct conceptual spaces to create novel blended concepts (Fauconnier & Turner).
      sigil_ref: ⚗️CONCEPT_ALCHEMY_STILL
    - name: SerendipityEnhancer_ExplorationDriver
      description: Introduces elements of randomness, curiosity, or playful exploration to break set and discover unexpected
        paths. May interact with dream states or random walks.

    explanation: 'This scaffold is invoked when the goal is not just problem-solving but true innovation or artistic creation.

      It moves beyond logical deduction or standard problem-solving heuristics to explore the "adjacent possible"

      and generate ideas that are surprising, original, and valuable. It''s key for tasks like design,

      scientific discovery, artistic composition, and strategic foresight.
