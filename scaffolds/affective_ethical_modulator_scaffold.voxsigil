  \ states, both internal and perceived in others. It also integrates \na component\

  explanation: 'This scaffold is crucial for agents intended for human interaction,
    collaborative tasks, or autonomous

    decision-making in socially sensitive contexts. It helps an agent to be not just
    intelligent,

    but also empathetic, considerate, and aligned with ethical norms.

    2.  **Ethical Deliberation:** Evaluate `{{potential_actions_list}}` against `{{relevant_ethics_codex_subset}}`
    using ü§îMORAL_REASONER, prioritizing `{{ethical_framework_priority}}`.

    3.  **Modulate & Select:** Use üõ†Ô∏èRESPONSE_TUNER to adjust or select an action/response
    that is both affectively appropriate (aiming for `{{empathy_level_target}}`) and
    ethically sound.


    Output the modulated action/response and a brief rationale for the affective/ethical

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Provides a framework for agents to recognize and model affective states
    (self and other), and to deliberate upon and modulate actions based on ethical
    principles and values.
  Measurable: Agent's ability to accurately identify emotions; alignment of agent
    behavior with specified ethical guidelines in test scenarios; human ratings of
    agent empathy and trustworthiness; reduction in ethically problematic behaviors.
  Achievable: Implementable by combining affect recognition models (e.g., from NLP,
    speech, vision), symbolic ethical rule engines or learned value functions, and
    decision modulation algorithms.
  Relevant: Crucial for developing AI systems that are socially intelligent, trustworthy,
    aligned with human values, and capable of nuanced interaction in complex human
    environments.
  Transferable: The core principles are applicable to any AI agent requiring social-emotional
    intelligence and ethical decision-making, from chatbots to autonomous robots.
