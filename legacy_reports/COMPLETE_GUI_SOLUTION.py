The hanging was caused by trying to instantiate all enhanced tabs 
simultaneously during GUI initialization. Each tab has complex 
VantaCore integration and heavy computations.

The lazy loading solution:
1. Creates placeholder tabs instantly
2. Loads actual content only when tab is accessed
3. Provides loading progress and error handling
4. Maintains full functionality

RESULT:
=======
