  principle: '⏳CHRONOS_SCRIBE is a cognitive module dedicated to understanding, constructing, and

    reasoning about events in their temporal context. It sequences events, analyzes causal

    relationships across time, constructs coherent historical narratives from timestamped or

    ordered data, and maintains chronological consistency. It is the AI''s historian,

    timeline manager, and causal investigator for processes unfolding over time.

    '
  math: 'Let E = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ} be a set of events with timestamps T(eᵢ) or partial orderings.

    Goal: Construct Timeline_TL(E) such that ∀(eᵢ, eⱼ) ∈ TL, IF T(eᵢ) < T(eⱼ) THEN Position(eᵢ) < Position(eⱼ).

    CausalLink_Score(eᵢ → eⱼ) = P(eⱼ | eᵢ, T(eⱼ) > T(eᵢ)) * Plausibility(Mechanism(eᵢ,eⱼ))

    NarrativeCoherence(TL) = f(CausalDensity(TL), ExplanatoryCompleteness(TL), ChronologicalConsistency(TL))

    explanation: 'Use ⏳CHRONOS_SCRIBE when understanding the order of events, their causal connections, or the historical
      development of a situation is critical. This applies to debugging, historical analysis, storytelling with consistent
      timelines, process mining, or any task where "when" and "why then" are key questions.
