principle: 'This sigil represents a foundational, often immutable, core principle,
  purpose, or

  long-term goal that guides an AI system''s overall behavior and decision-making.

  It acts as a "North Star," ensuring that all actions, however complex or

  autonomously derived, remain aligned with this ultimate directive. It is the symbolic

  embodiment of the system''s raison d''être or highest value.

  explanation: 'The 🌟GUIDING_STAR sigil is typically set at system inception or during
    major

    re-evaluations of purpose. All other goals, strategies, and ethical rules should

    be demonstrably aligned with or subservient to it. It is queried internally during

    critical decision-making or when resolving goal conflicts.

  trigger_conditions:
  - System initialization
  - Critical decision with long-term consequences
  - Resolution of conflicting sub-goals
  - Evaluation of new strategies for alignment
  - Ethical dilemma resolution
  preconditions:
  - The principle of the GUIDING_STAR must be clearly and unambiguously defined (even
    if abstract).

  contraindications:
  - Should not be frequently changed, as this undermines its purpose as a stable anchor.
    Defining multiple conflicting GUIDING_STARs is a critical system flaw.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Serve as the ultimate, symbolically encoded reference point for an AI
    system's core purpose or highest-order value, ensuring all strategic decisions,
    goal formulations, and ethical judgments are consistently aligned with this foundational
    principle.
  Measurable: Demonstrable alignment of system actions and policies with the stated
    principle (auditable); Reduction in goal conflicts that violate the principle;
    Long-term trajectory of system behavior consistent with the GUIDING_STAR.
  Achievable: By embedding the principle as a high-weight factor in utility functions,
    as a top-level constraint in decision-making algorithms, and as the root of a
    hierarchical goal network.
  Relevant: Absolutely critical for AI safety, value alignment, long-term beneficial
    development of AGI, and establishing trust in autonomous systems. It defines 'good'
    for the AI.
  Transferable: A necessary concept for any sufficiently advanced autonomous system,
    from specialized AIs with critical societal roles (e.g., in governance, resource
    management) to future AGI.
