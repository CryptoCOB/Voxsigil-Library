  principle: 'This sigil represents a foundational, often immutable, core principle, purpose, or

    long-term goal that guides an AI system''s overall behavior and decision-making.

    It acts as a "North Star," ensuring that all actions, however complex or

    autonomously derived, remain aligned with this ultimate directive. It is the symbolic

    embodiment of the system''s raison d''être or highest value.

    explanation: 'The 🌟GUIDING_STAR sigil is typically set at system inception or during major

      re-evaluations of purpose. All other goals, strategies, and ethical rules should

      be demonstrably aligned with or subservient to it. It is queried internally during

      critical decision-making or when resolving goal conflicts.
