principle: 'This sigil represents a foundational, often immutable, core principle,
  purpose, or

  long-term goal that guides an AI system''s overall behavior and decision-making.

  It acts as a "North Star," ensuring that all actions, however complex or

  autonomously derived, remain aligned with this ultimate directive. It is the symbolic

  embodiment of the system''s raison d''√™tre or highest value.

  explanation: 'The üåüGUIDING_STAR sigil is typically set at system inception or during
    major

    re-evaluations of purpose. All other goals, strategies, and ethical rules should

    be demonstrably aligned with or subservient to it. It is queried internally during

    critical decision-making or when resolving goal conflicts.

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - System initialization
  - Critical decision with long-term consequences
  - Resolution of conflicting sub-goals
  - Evaluation of new strategies for alignment
  - Ethical dilemma resolution
  preconditions:
  - The principle of the GUIDING_STAR must be clearly and unambiguously defined (even
    if abstract).

  contraindications:
  - Should not be frequently changed, as this undermines its purpose as a stable anchor.
    Defining multiple conflicting GUIDING_STARs is a critical system flaw.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Serve as the ultimate, symbolically encoded reference point for an AI
    system's core purpose or highest-order value, ensuring all strategic decisions,
    goal formulations, and ethical judgments are consistently aligned with this foundational
    principle.
  Measurable: Demonstrable alignment of system actions and policies with the stated
    principle (auditable); Reduction in goal conflicts that violate the principle;
    Long-term trajectory of system behavior consistent with the GUIDING_STAR.
  Achievable: By embedding the principle as a high-weight factor in utility functions,
    as a top-level constraint in decision-making algorithms, and as the root of a
    hierarchical goal network.
  Relevant: Absolutely critical for AI safety, value alignment, long-term beneficial
    development of AGI, and establishing trust in autonomous systems. It defines 'good'
    for the AI.
  Transferable: A necessary concept for any sufficiently advanced autonomous system,
    from specialized AIs with critical societal roles (e.g., in governance, resource
    management) to future AGI.
