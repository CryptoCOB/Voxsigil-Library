principle: 'üú™TRIALOGOS orchestrates a recursive ideation circuit engaging three symbolic
  agents (or agent roles).

  Each agent independently generates a set of distinct, novel proposals (typically
  three) derived from a shared prompt, sigil, or problem statement. This structured
  divergence is followed by a synthesis phase, where the collective output is woven
  into a new, higher-order cognitive structure or solution, often employing mechanisms
  like üúÅCHIMERA for fusion or üîÆQUANTA_STATE/üîÄREMIX for selective merging or combinatorial
  exploration. It is rooted in Platonic dialogue, recursive reflection, and aims for
  "symbolic alchemy" ‚Äì transmuting individual ideas into a more valuable collective
  insight.

  explanation: 'Each assigned agent (or an LLM adopting the specified role) offers
    a defined number of ideas (typically 3). A synthesis layer then fuses these diverse
    perspectives, often using üúÅCHIMERA for holistic fusion or üîÆQUANTA_STATE for selective
    combination. üú™TRIALOGOS is best employed for recursive ideation, designing symbolic
    architectures, exploring divergent solutions, or generating rich conceptual material.
    The glyph ''üú™'' suggests sublimation ‚Äî the refinement and elevation of idea essence
    through structured dialogue and recursion.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Orchestrate a three-agent (or three-role) recursive dialogue where each
    agent generates a set of distinct proposals based on a shared input, followed
    by a synthesis phase (e.g., using üúÅCHIMERA) to produce a novel, integrated output,
    aiming for 'symbolic alchemy'.
  Measurable: Number and novelty of unique ideas generated across agents; Diversity
    of symbolic expressions or approaches used; Coherence and utility of the synthesized
    output (e.g., rated by humans or performance on a downstream task); 'Remix density'
    or degree of intermingling of ideas in the final synthesis.
  Achievable: Within LLM environments supporting role-playing system prompts, or in
    multi-agent systems where distinct agent instances can be invoked and their outputs
    programmatically collected and processed by a synthesis module.
  Relevant: Ideal for complex problem-solving, generating new symbolic designs (e.g.,
    VoxSigils, cognitive architectures), evolving system prompts, fostering creative
    breakthroughs by combining diverse perspectives, and exploring abstract conceptual
    spaces.
  Transferable: The protocol is model-agnostic and can be implemented with various
    LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.) or symbolic AI agents, provided they can generate constrained
    outputs and a synthesis mechanism is available. Useful in creative industries,
    R&D, strategic planning, and system design.

    motivation: To create a structured yet highly generative protocol for multi-agent
      ideation and symbolic creation, moving beyond simple brainstorming to a more
      alchemical process of transmutation. Specifically useful for designing new sigils,
      reasoning structures, or meta-prompts. Supports recursive loops, divergent synthesis,
      and reflection DAGs.

    current_limitations_summary: Requires careful prompt engineering for agent roles
      to ensure true diversity. Synthesis phase can be computationally expensive.
      Managing turn-taking or deeper recursion within TRIALOGOS adds complexity.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Dynamic adjustment of agent roles based on problem type
    - Automated evaluation of proposal diversity to prompt re-generation if too similar
    - N-logos (more than 3 agents) with adaptive synthesis strategies.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What is the optimal number of agents/roles for maximizing creative output in
      such a protocol?
    - How can the synthesis phase be optimized to best leverage the specific strengths
      of different agent contributions?
    - Can TRIALOGOS learn to self-moderate or evolve its own structure for better
      performance?
