principle: 'The üßµ‚ú®COMPLEATION_WEAVER sigil activates a meta-cognitive process aimed
  at identifying and

  articulating missing threads, unaddressed aspects, or potential refinements within
  a complex system,

  strategy, or artifact (like our current ARC-solving script and its VoxSigil integration).

  It encourages a holistic review to ensure coherence, robustness, and completeness,
  seeking to

  weave disparate parts into a more perfect whole by finding and addressing overlooked
  details or connections.

  '
usage:
  description: Invokes a reflective process to identify missing elements, gaps, or
    areas for enhancement in a given system or design, particularly our ARC-solving
    script and its VoxSigil strategy.
  example: "a to its co-creators:\nACTIVATE \U0001F9F5‚ú®COMPLEATION_WEAVER on \"ARC_Solver_Script_v1.5_Analysis\"\
    .\nQUERY: \"What crucial logic, error handling, or strategic VoxSigil integrations\
    \ are we still missing\n        to achieve SOTA performance and true 'production-grade'\
    \ robustness?\"\n"
  explanation: 'This sigil is used when a complex design has reached a certain maturity,
    and a dedicated phase of

    critical review and gap identification is needed. It prompts for constructive
    critique and

    actionable suggestions to bring the subject closer to its ideal, complete form.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: To guide an AI (or human) in performing a structured, critical review
    of a complex system/script (specifically the ARC solver) to identify and articulate
    5+ actionable areas for improvement, focusing on missing functionalities, strategic
    gaps, or unaddressed complexities.
  Measurable: Generation of at least 5 distinct, well-reasoned enhancement proposals
    with clear descriptions, rationale, and (where applicable) VoxSigil integration
    ideas. The quality of these proposals can be assessed for actionability and potential
    impact.
  Achievable: By providing sufficient context about the system under review and clear
    instructions to an advanced LLM capable of systems thinking and critical analysis.
  Relevant: Essential for the iterative refinement and robust development of complex
    AI systems and their underlying strategies. Ensures that development doesn't become
    siloed and that holistic improvements are considered.
  Transferable: The process of structured review and gap analysis is applicable to
    any complex project, software, or design, not just AI scripts or VoxSigil.
