cognitive:
  principle: 'The 🧵✨COMPLEATION_WEAVER sigil activates a meta-cognitive process aimed at identifying and

    articulating missing threads, unaddressed aspects, or potential refinements within a complex system,

    strategy, or artifact (like our current ARC-solving script and its VoxSigil integration).

    It encourages a holistic review to ensure coherence, robustness, and completeness, seeking to

    weave disparate parts into a more perfect whole by finding and addressing overlooked details or connections.

    explanation: 'This sigil is used when a complex design has reached a certain maturity, and a dedicated phase of

      critical review and gap identification is needed. It prompts for constructive critique and

      actionable suggestions to bring the subject closer to its ideal, complete form.
