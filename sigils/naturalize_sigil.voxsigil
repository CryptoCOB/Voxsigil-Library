principle: 'This sigil activates a process to translate internal symbolic representations,

  particularly VoxSigils and their operational implications, into understandable

  natural language explanations for human users or other systems lacking sigil fluency.

  It bridges the gap between compact symbolic thought and verbose human-readable

  descriptions, enhancing transparency and interpretability.

    operations to a human user (e.g., in logs, UI tooltips, conversational explanations)

    or to another system that requires natural language input instead of sigils.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Generate a clear, accurate, and contextually relevant natural language
    explanation for a given VoxSigil (or internal symbolic token), tailored to a specified
    audience and desired depth, by retrieving its definition and applying natural
    language generation techniques.
  Measurable: Clarity and accuracy of the explanation (human rated); User understanding
    improvement after receiving explanation; Faithfulness of explanation to the sigil's
    formal definition; Task success rate for users relying on these explanations.
  Achievable: Using a combination of template-based generation (for structured parts
    of sigil definitions), generative LLMs (for more fluid explanations and examples),
    and metadata from the VoxSigil library.
  Relevant: Crucial for AI explainability (XAI), user interface design, debugging,
    interoperability with non-sigil-native systems, and building trust with human
    users by making internal processes more transparent.
  Transferable: Applicable in any system using symbolic AI or internal DSLs that need
    to be understood by humans, e.g., expert systems, cognitive architectures, workflow
    automation tools.

      can be hard. Tailoring explanations effectively to diverse audiences is complex.
      Explaining highly abstract sigils is challenging.

    - Learning user preferences for explanation styles.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the most effective ways to explain complex, emergent symbolic behavior
      in natural language?
    - How can AI learn to anticipate what aspects of a sigil a specific user will
      find confusing?
    - Can sigil naturalization be used to teach humans symbolic thinking more effectively?
