principle: 'This sigil invokes or simulates a cognitive state analogous to dreaming,
  characterized by

  loosened associations, symbolic fluidity, and the emergence of novel connections
  between

  disparate concepts. It temporarily reduces the dominance of strict logical constraints,

  allowing for more intuitive, metaphorical, and serendipitous ideation. It is a wellspring

  for originality and reframing.

  explanation: 'Use üåíDREAM_STATE when conventional thinking hits a roadblock or when
    the goal is to

    generate highly original or artistic content. It''s a tool for breaking set and

    exploring the "what ifs" that lie beyond the immediately obvious. It can be parameterized

    for intensity and duration.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Modulate cognitive processing to favor associative, non-linear, and metaphorical
    thought patterns, using seed concepts to explore latent connections and generate
    novel ideas or narratives.
  Measurable: Number of novel metaphors generated; Semantic distance of associations
    made; Originality score of output (human or AI judged); Branching factor of conceptual
    exploration.
  Achievable: By implementing algorithms that temporarily down-weight direct semantic
    links, up-weight distant/weak links, and employ generative models biased towards
    figurative language and narrative construction.
  Relevant: Crucial for AI creativity, art generation, complex problem reframing,
    and simulating more human-like intuition and inspiration.
  Transferable: Applicable in creative writing aids, scientific hypothesis generation,
    artistic composition tools, and therapeutic conversational agents.
