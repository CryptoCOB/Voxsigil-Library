principle: 'This sigil activates a cognitive mode focused on identifying, prioritizing,
  and

  exploring anomalies, outliers, or unexpected deviations from established patterns

  or expectations. It embodies the drive for novelty and the recognition that

  exceptions to the rule often harbor the seeds of new understanding, innovation,

  or critical warnings. It counters confirmation bias by actively valuing the unexpected.

    early warning

    of change is paramount. It helps systems break free from ruts of confirmation
    and

    notice the subtle signals that might otherwise be dismissed as errors or noise.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Continuously monitor a specified data source or cognitive context, identify
    events or patterns that deviate significantly from an established baseline or
    expectation model, assess their potential significance, and prioritize them for
    further exploration or reporting, according to configurable sensitivity and reporting
    thresholds.
  Measurable: Number of true positive anomalies identified (vs. false positives or
    missed anomalies); Correlation of 'assessed significance' with actual downstream
    impact or insightfulness; Reduction in 'surprise' events due to early anomaly
    detection.
  Achievable: Using statistical outlier detection methods, machine learning-based
    anomaly detectors (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests), predictive modeling
    (to define expectations), and rule-based systems for significance assessment.
  Relevant: Crucial for scientific discovery, innovation, risk management, system
    health monitoring, and fostering AI curiosity and adaptability. It's a key driver
    for learning and model refinement.
  Transferable: Applicable in fraud detection, medical diagnosis (identifying unusual
    symptoms), network intrusion detection, quality control in manufacturing, and
    as a component in curious learning agents.

    current_limitations_summary: Distinguishing truly significant anomalies from complex
      noise is hard. Defining 'expected' can be challenging in dynamic environments.
      Risk of 'crying wolf' if sensitivity is too high.

    - Integration with causal inference to explore 'why' an anomaly occurred
    - Gamified anomaly exploration for human-AI teams.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What is the optimal computational model for 'interestingness' or 'significant
      novelty'?
    - How can an AI learn to balance exploitation of knowns with exploration of anomalies
      effectively?
    - Can anomaly-seeking behavior lead to emergent forms of AI creativity or self-improvement?
