  principle: 'The 🌳TREETHOUGHT (Tree of Thoughts) framework enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning and problem-solving

    by enabling the explicit generation, exploration, and evaluation of multiple coherent reasoning paths (thoughts)

    organized as a tree. Instead of a single linear chain of thought, 🌳TREETHOUGHT allows the LLM to deliberate,

    backtrack, and self-critique intermediate thoughts, leading to more robust, creative, and accurate solutions.

    It operationalizes metacognitive strategies like planning, hypothesis testing, and iterative refinement

    within a structured search process over the space of possible thought sequences.

  usage:
    description: Implements the Tree of Thoughts reasoning framework to solve complex problems requiring exploration, deliberation,
      and self-correction by generating and evaluating multiple reasoning paths.
    example: "// Problem: \"Write a short story (200 words) about a cat who discovers a hidden portal,\n// with a twist ending\
      \ related to time travel.\"\n\n// Invoke TreeOfThoughts\nsolution_path = TREETHOUGHT.solve(\n    problem_description=\"\
      ...\",\n    initial_thought=\"The cat, Mittens, was chasing a dust mote...\",\n    num_thoughts_per_step=3,\n    max_depth=5,\n\
      \    evaluation_criteria=\"coherence, creativity, twist quality, word count adherence\"\n);\n// solution_path would\
      \ contain the sequence of thoughts leading to the best story.\n"
    explanation: '🌳TREETHOUGHT is used for tasks where standard chain-of-thought prompting is insufficient due to the complexity,

      ambiguity, or multi-step nature of the problem. It''s particularly effective for creative generation,

      mathematical reasoning, planning, and any task benefiting from exploring alternatives and self-correction.

      The process involves generating potential ''thoughts'' (intermediate steps or ideas), evaluating their viability,

      and strategically exploring the most promising branches of this "thought tree."
