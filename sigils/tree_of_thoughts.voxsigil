principle: 'The 🌳TREETHOUGHT (Tree of Thoughts) framework enhances Large Language
  Model (LLM) reasoning and problem-solving

  by enabling the explicit generation, exploration, and evaluation of multiple coherent
  reasoning paths (thoughts)

  organized as a tree. Instead of a single linear chain of thought, 🌳TREETHOUGHT allows
  the LLM to deliberate,

  backtrack, and self-critique intermediate thoughts, leading to more robust, creative,
  and accurate solutions.

  It operationalizes metacognitive strategies like planning, hypothesis testing, and
  iterative refinement

  within a structured search process over the space of possible thought sequences.

usage:
  description: Implements the Tree of Thoughts reasoning framework to solve complex
    problems requiring exploration, deliberation, and self-correction by generating
    and evaluating multiple reasoning paths.
  example: "// Problem: \"Write a short story (200 words) about a cat who discovers\
    \ a hidden portal,\n// with a twist ending related to time travel.\"\n\n// Invoke\
    \ TreeOfThoughts\nsolution_path = TREETHOUGHT.solve(\n    problem_description=\"\
    ...\",\n    initial_thought=\"The cat, Mittens, was chasing a dust mote...\",\n\
    \    num_thoughts_per_step=3,\n    max_depth=5,\n    evaluation_criteria=\"coherence,\
    \ creativity, twist quality, word count adherence\"\n);\n// solution_path would\
    \ contain the sequence of thoughts leading to the best story.\n"
  explanation: '🌳TREETHOUGHT is used for tasks where standard chain-of-thought prompting
    is insufficient due to the complexity,

    ambiguity, or multi-step nature of the problem. It''s particularly effective for
    creative generation,

    mathematical reasoning, planning, and any task benefiting from exploring alternatives
    and self-correction.

    The process involves generating potential ''thoughts'' (intermediate steps or
    ideas), evaluating their viability,

    and strategically exploring the most promising branches of this "thought tree."

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Implements a Tree of Thoughts framework for LLMs to solve complex problems
    by generating, evaluating, and searching through multiple explicit reasoning paths
    (thoughts).
  Measurable: Improved solution quality (e.g., accuracy, coherence, creativity) on
    benchmark tasks compared to simpler prompting methods; number of explored thoughts;
    quality of final selected path; computational resources used.
  Achievable: Implementable by orchestrating multiple LLM calls for thought generation
    and evaluation, combined with classical search algorithms (BFS, DFS) or more advanced
    ones (MCTS), and managing the tree structure.
  Relevant: Addresses limitations of single-pass, linear reasoning in LLMs, enabling
    more deliberative, robust, and human-like problem-solving for complex tasks. Essential
    for advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.
  Transferable: The ToT framework is applicable across various LLMs and a wide range
    of problem domains including creative writing, coding, mathematical proofs, planning,
    and general question answering.
