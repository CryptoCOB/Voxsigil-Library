principle: 'This sigil activates a process that interweaves multiple strands of memory,
  experience,

  or information from different timelines, agents, or cognitive threads into a single,

  coherent, and contextually enriched narrative or understanding. It''s not just

  concatenation but a true synthesis, highlighting connections, resolving minor

  discrepancies, and constructing a holistic view from fragmented parts.

  '
math: 'Braided_Memory_M = Œ£ w·µ¢ * Transform(Memory_Strand·µ¢) + Œì(Contextual_Links)

  Coherence(M) = 1 / Dissonance(M)

  where w·µ¢ are weights, Œì represents emergent links.

  explanation: 'Use üï∏Ô∏èMEMORY_BRAID_ALGORITHM when an agent needs to form a comprehensive
    picture

    from multiple, potentially overlapping or divergent, information sources that
    represent

    different facets of an experience or a corpus of knowledge. Essential for multi-agent

    collaboration and long-term memory consolidation.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Integrate multiple distinct memory strands (from various agents, times,
    or modalities) into a single, coherent, and contextually enriched narrative or
    knowledge structure, highlighting interconnections and resolving minor conflicts
    according to a specified focus and coherence priority.
  Measurable: Coherence and comprehensiveness of the resulting narrative (human or
    AI judged); Number of meaningful cross-strand links identified; Reduction in information
    redundancy; Successful resolution of minor discrepancies.
  Achievable: By implementing algorithms for data aggregation, temporal alignment,
    semantic linking (e.g., using embeddings, knowledge graphs), narrative structuring,
    and basic conflict resolution heuristics.
  Relevant: Crucial for systems that learn from multiple experiences over time, for
    multi-agent collaboration where shared understanding is key, and for providing
    users with coherent summaries of complex interaction histories.
  Transferable: Applicable in project management (integrating team member reports),
    historical analysis (weaving disparate accounts), personal information management
    (creating a unified journal), and AI storytelling.

    suggested_next_features:
    - Interactive conflict resolution involving user/agent feedback
    - Automated detection of 'significant' discrepancies warranting deeper analysis
    - Multi-modal braiding (e.g., text with images).
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the most effective computational representations for 'narrative coherence'?
    - How can memory braiding preserve essential nuances of individual strands while
      creating a unified whole?
    - Can this process lead to emergent insights not present in any single strand?
