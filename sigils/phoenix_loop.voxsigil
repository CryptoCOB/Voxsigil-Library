principle: '🜔PHOENIX embodies the principle of regenerative feedback combined with
  selective forgetting.

  Inspired by iterative renewal and the concept of "creative destruction," it prunes
  stale,

  redundant, or low-value information from a cognitive system''s memory or context.

  It then allows for the "regrowth" or reintegration of core insights or new information

  into a cleaner, more focused cognitive state. It''s a mechanism for memory hygiene,

  long-chain coherence, and escaping cognitive ruts by "burning down" the old to make

  way for the new.

  '
math: 'MemoryState(t+1) = Prune(MemoryState(t), Threshold_φ) ⊕ Integrate(NewInsight_Δ,
  CoreSchema_S)

  Prune_Criteria(Information_i) = ValueScore(i) < Threshold_φ OR Entropy(i) > Threshold_ε

  ValueScore(i) ∝ Relevance(i, CurrentGoal) * Recency(i) * Connectivity(i)

usage:
  description: Triggers a process of selective memory pruning and context regeneration
    to refresh cognitive state, improve coherence, and integrate new insights effectively.
  example: "<long_running_research_agent>\n  <status>Context window nearing saturation,\
    \ reasoning becoming circular.</status>\n  <invoke_memory_renewal>\U0001F714PHOENIX\
    \ retention_heuristic=\"keep_core_hypotheses\" new_input_source=\"latest_findings_summary\"\

  explanation: 'Invoke 🜔PHOENIX when a cognitive process has become stale, its context
    window is bloated with irrelevant information, or a radical shift in perspective
    is needed. It "burns away" the less valuable parts of the current memory or context,
    retaining the "ashes" (core insights) from which a new, more potent understanding
    can grow, often incorporating new data (Δ).

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Cognitive stagnation or circular reasoning detected
  - Context window saturation
  - High memory entropy or low signal-to-noise ratio
  - Major shift in goals requiring context re-evaluation
  - Periodic memory hygiene cycle
  preconditions:
  - A mutable memory or context state
  - Defined criteria or heuristics for valuing and pruning information
  - Mechanism to preserve or reintroduce core knowledge

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Selectively prune an agent's memory or context based on defined value/relevance
    criteria and a chosen retention heuristic, then regenerate a more focused and
    coherent cognitive state, optionally integrating new insights, to improve performance
    and adaptability.
  Measurable: Reduction in memory size/context length; Improvement in downstream task
    performance (e.g., speed, accuracy) after regeneration; Coherence score of the
    regenerated context; Percentage of critical information successfully retained.
  Achievable: By implementing algorithms for information scoring (e.g., based on TF-IDF,
    graph centrality, relevance to goals, recency), threshold-based pruning, knowledge
    distillation techniques, and context rebuilding mechanisms.
  Relevant: Essential for long-running AI agents, systems with limited context windows,
    or processes that require adaptation and escape from cognitive ruts. Improves
    long-chain coherence and memory hygiene.
  Transferable: Applicable to LLMs managing extensive conversational history, reinforcement
    learning agents pruning experiential memory, expert systems updating knowledge
    bases, and any AI that needs to manage information overload and maintain focus.

    current_limitations_summary: Risk of catastrophically forgetting vital information
      if heuristics are flawed. Defining 'value' of information is context-dependent

    suggested_next_features:

    - Learning optimal pruning strategies from experience
    - Gradual 'fading' of memory instead of hard pruning for some info types.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the most robust general-purpose heuristics for information valuation
      in dynamic AI systems?
    - How can the Phoenix process itself be made self-tuning to avoid over- or under-pruning?
    - Can AI learn to anticipate when a Phoenix cycle would be most beneficial?
