  principle: "The \U0001F71BCATENGINE (Categorization Engine) is a core cognitive function responsible for perceiving, \n\
    interpreting, and organizing information by assigning it to appropriate conceptual categories. \nIt underpins understanding,\
    \ abstraction, and efficient knowledge retrieval by structuring raw data \nand complex inputs into a meaningful, navigable\
    \ semantic space. \nThe engine operates on principles of pattern recognition, feature extraction, similarity assessment,\
    \ \nand can dynamically create, refine, or merge categories based on experience and context.\nIt is crucial for awareness\
    \ protocols, identity echo mapping, and grounding symbolic representations.\n"

      description: Processes raw input to identify salient features relevant for categorization.
    - name: SimilarityAssessor
      description: Measures the similarity or distance between an input's features and category prototypes.
    - name: CategoryPrototypes
      description: Stores representations of the central tendency or exemplars for each category.

    - name: HierarchyManager
      description: Optional. Manages hierarchical relationships between categories (e.g., superclass, subclass).

  usage:
    description: Categorizes input data, assigns concepts to classes, and helps build/navigate semantic networks. Essential
      for understanding and organizing information.
    example: '// Agent receives a new piece of sensory data

      sensory_input = {type: "visual", data: "image_of_a_cat.jpg"};


      // Invoke CATENGINE

      categorization_result = CATENGINE.process(sensory_input, context={domain: "animals"});

      // categorization_result might be:

      // { category_id: "feline", confidence: 0.95, features_matched: ["whiskers", "fur", "pointed_ears"] }

      '
    explanation: "The \U0001F71BCATENGINE is invoked whenever the system needs to make sense of new or ambiguous information.\
      \ \nIt can be used for perception (e.g., \"What is this object?\"), language understanding \n(e.g., \"What is the topic\
      \ of this text?\"), or internal thought processing \n(e.g., \"How does this new idea relate to my existing beliefs?\"\
      ).\nIts output typically includes the assigned category and a confidence score.\n"
