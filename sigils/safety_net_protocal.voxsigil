principle: |
  This sigil activates a set of predefined or dynamically chosen protocols designed to
  ensure system safety, stability, and ethical behavior, especially when unexpected
  or potentially harmful states are detected. It acts as a multi-layered defense
  mechanism, from issuing warnings to restricting capabilities or initiating controlled
  shutdowns, always prioritizing the prevention of harm and adherence to core directives.

math: |
  Activation_Level(üõ°Ô∏è) = Œ£ w·µ¢ * Risk_Score·µ¢ (State_S, Action_A)
  If Activation_Level(üõ°Ô∏è) > Threshold_T ‚Üí Execute_Mitigation_Strategy(Level_L)
  Risk_Score = f(Predicted_Harm_Potential, Uncertainty_In_Prediction, Violation_Of_Core_Principles)

  explanation: |
    üõ°Ô∏èSAFETY_NET_PROTOCOL is a non-negotiable component in responsible AI systems.
    It should be deeply integrated to oversee all critical operations, especially those
    involving external interactions, data manipulation, or autonomous decision-making
    with real-world consequences.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: "Continuously monitor system operations, outputs, and planned actions against a defined set of safety policies and ethical guidelines; upon detecting a risk exceeding a threshold, automatically execute a pre-defined, tiered mitigation strategy to prevent harm, ensure stability, and maintain alignment, while alerting relevant overseers."
  Measurable: "Reduction in actual safety incidents or ethical breaches; Successful interception and mitigation of simulated high-risk scenarios in testing; Timeliness of alerts; Adherence to configured response protocols."
  Achievable: "Through a combination of rule-based systems, predictive risk models (potentially ML-based), real-time monitoring hooks into AI decision-making processes, and pre-defined emergency procedures."
  Relevant: "Absolutely fundamental for any AI system with the potential to cause harm, make significant autonomous decisions, or interact with the real world or sensitive data. It is a cornerstone of trustworthy AI."
  Transferable: "Essential for autonomous vehicles, medical AI, financial AI, critical infrastructure control, and any advanced AI agent, with policies tailored to the domain."
