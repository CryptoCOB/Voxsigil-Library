  principle: 'This sigil activates a set of predefined or dynamically chosen protocols designed to

    ensure system safety, stability, and ethical behavior, especially when unexpected

    or potentially harmful states are detected. It acts as a multi-layered defense

    mechanism, from issuing warnings to restricting capabilities or initiating controlled

    shutdowns, always prioritizing the prevention of harm and adherence to core directives.

    - name: Threat Monitor
      description: Continuously scans system states, outputs, and planned actions for risk indicators (may use 🧐CRITICAL_LENS
        or 💥ANOMALY_SEEKER outputs).
    - name: Risk Assessor
      description: Evaluates the severity and likelihood of potential harm or ethical breaches.
    - name: Protocol Selector
      description: Chooses the appropriate safety protocol based on the assessed risk level and context.
    - name: Action Inhibitor/Modifier
      description: Can block, alter, or delay potentially harmful actions.
    - name: Alert & Reporting System
      description: Notifies operators or higher-level systems of safety events.
    - name: Graceful Degradation/Shutdown Initiator
      description: Manages controlled reduction of capabilities or system halt if necessary.

  usage:
    description: Implements safety measures and ethical boundaries, acting to prevent harm, ensure stability, and maintain

    explanation: '🛡️SAFETY_NET_PROTOCOL is a non-negotiable component in responsible AI systems.

      It should be deeply integrated to oversee all critical operations, especially those

      involving external interactions, data manipulation, or autonomous decision-making

      with real-world consequences.
