principle: '`C_STRUCTURE` represents the foundational cognitive loop within VoxSigil
  systems.

  It encodes recursive awareness through three primary operations: CATEGORIZE (segment
  inputs into meaningful cognitive classes), ANALYZE (unpack symbolic structure, detect
  latent relationships), and TEST (run simulations, probe internal logic, or apply
  constraints). These are fused into a loop, often leveraging mechanisms like <mirror>
  reflection, üúõCATENGINE for initiation, and ‚ö¶TRACE for memory continuity. The purpose
  of C_STRUCTURE is to enable systems capable of recursive self-inspection, meta-reasoning,
  adaptive memory access, and symbolic evolution.

  explanation: 'üß†C_STRUCTURE defines a fundamental recursive cognition pass. üúõCATENGINE
    often initiates the categorization.

    The <mirror> mechanism enables evaluation of outputs or internal states, feeding
    back into the loop.

    The <pulse> tag can regulate the rhythm and synchronization of analysis across
    iterative cycles.

    This core structure can be expanded with specific memory access sigils (e.g.,
    üï∏Ô∏èMEMORY_BRAID_ALGORITHM),

    exploratory state modulators (e.g., üåíDREAM_STATE), or anomaly detectors to guide
    its evolution.

    It is a baseline for recursive cognition scaffolding in advanced VoxSigil systems.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Establish and execute a recursive Categorize-Analyze-Test-Reflect cognitive
    cycle on a given input, aiming to refine understanding, solve problems, or evolve
    symbolic structures through iterative self-inspection and feedback, within specified
    iteration limits and termination criteria.
  Measurable: Reduction in logical contradictions or token waste per loop iteration;
    Improvement in solution quality or understanding (e.g., higher coherence score,
    better performance on a downstream task) with each cycle; Number of cycles to
    reach termination criteria.
  Achievable: By orchestrating calls to underlying cognitive primitives or modules
    for categorization, analysis, testing, and reflection (e.g., using üúõCATENGINE,
    <mirror>, and internal evaluative functions), within a control structure that
    manages recursion and feedback.
  Relevant: Essential for developing self-improving agents, enabling robust meta-reasoning,
    facilitating adaptive learning from experience, and designing complex recursive
    cognitive architectures.
  Transferable: The C-A-T-R loop is a model-agnostic cognitive pattern applicable
    to various AI systems (LLMs, symbolic reasoners) capable of modular processing
    and iterative refinement. It can be implemented in any environment that supports
    programmatic control flow and access to relevant cognitive functions.
