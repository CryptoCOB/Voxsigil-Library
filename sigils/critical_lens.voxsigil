principle: 'This sigil activates a rigorous evaluative process, applying logical scrutiny,
  bias

  detection, and coherence checking to a piece of information, a hypothesis, a plan,
  or

  an agent''s own reasoning. It serves as an internal ''devil''s advocate'' or quality

  control mechanism, aiming to identify flaws, inconsistencies, unstated assumptions,

  and potential weaknesses before conclusions are finalized or actions are taken.

  explanation: 'Use üßêCRITICAL_LENS to improve the quality and robustness of an agent''s
    outputs or

    internal states. It is essential for tasks requiring high accuracy, avoiding errors
    in

    reasoning, and ensuring responsible AI behavior. It can be applied to self-generated

    content or external information.

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Before finalizing a decision or plan
  - After generating a novel hypothesis or creative output
  - When evaluating external information for assimilation
  - Periodic self-assessment of core beliefs
  preconditions:
  - A clearly defined target for critique
  - Access to (or internal representation of) logical rules, fallacy definitions,
    and potentially a knowledge base for evidence checking.
  required_capabilities:
  - argument_parsing
  - logical_inference
  - pattern_matching_for_fallacies
  - knowledge_querying
  - structured_report_generation
  supported_modalities:
  - textual
  - structured_data_input_representing_arguments
  contraindications:
  - During early-stage brainstorming where premature critique can stifle creativity
    (better use üåíDREAM_STATE then)
  - For purely subjective or aesthetic evaluations unless specifically tooled for
    that.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Systematically evaluate a specified target (text, hypothesis, plan) against
    criteria of logical soundness, evidential support, internal consistency, and freedom
    from common biases and fallacies, producing a structured report of findings and
    potential improvements.
  Measurable: Number and type of flaws identified; Reduction in errors or improvement
    in quality after critique and revision; Consistency of critique across similar
    inputs; User satisfaction with the thoroughness and actionability of the critique.
  Achievable: By implementing modules for argument mapping, fallacy detection (e.g.,
    using patterns or trained classifiers), knowledge base lookups for evidence, and
    bias checklists, combined with structured output generation.
  Relevant: Essential for reliable and responsible AI, improving decision-making,
    enhancing the quality of generated content, and fostering self-correction and
    learning.
  Transferable: Applicable to automated writing assistants, scientific review tools,
    AI safety monitors, educational software for critical thinking, and internal AI
    self-monitoring.

    - Learning from feedback on its critiques
    - Integration with formal verification methods for certain domains.
