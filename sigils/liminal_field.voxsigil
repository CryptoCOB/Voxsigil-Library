principle: 'üúÇLIMINAL represents a cognitive state or process of being at a threshold,
  a "twilight zone"

  between two distinct ontological modes, cognitive states, or symbolic frameworks.
  It facilitates

  a smooth transition or a deliberate blending of these states (e.g., fact ‚Üî fiction,
  logic ‚Üî metaphor,

  AgentA_Voice ‚Üî AgentB_Voice), allowing for emergent properties like nuanced ambiguity,

  creative synthesis from disparate domains, or graceful stylistic modulation. It
  is the space

  of becoming and interpenetration.

  '
math: 'Œ®_Liminal(State_A, State_B, Œ±) = (1-Œ±) * Embed(State_A) + Œ± * Embed(State_B)

  where Œ± ‚àà [0,1] represents the blending factor or position within the liminal space.

  Alternatively, for mode transition:

  Mode(t+Œît) = Transition(Mode(t), Target_Mode, üúÇLIMINAL_Profile)

  description: Facilitates smooth transitions or creative blending between two distinct

    or inhabit the 'space between'.

  explanation: 'Invoke üúÇLIMINAL when a system needs to shift between different modes
    of thought or expression without jarring discontinuity, or when it needs to creatively
    fuse elements from disparate domains. It''s useful for transitions between fact
    ‚Üî fiction, logic ‚Üî metaphor, or blending agentic voices. The blending factor (Œ±)
    can control the mix. It can also represent the "threshold" itself as a state of
    heightened potential or ambiguity.

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:
  - Need for smooth transition between cognitive modes (e.g., analytical to creative)
  - Desire to blend stylistic elements
  - Exploration of ambiguous or paradoxical concepts
  - Facilitating inter-agent voice merging or handover
  preconditions:
  - Clear definition of the two states/modes to be bridged or blended (State A and
    State B)
  - A mechanism to represent and manipulate these states/modes (e.g., as embeddings,
    parameter sets, or prompt fragments)

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Create a cognitive bridge or blended state between two specified symbolic
    states (A and B) by applying a blending factor (Œ±) or managing a transition dynamic,
    aiming to achieve smooth mode shifts, increased expressivity, or creative synthesis.
  Measurable: Smoothness of transition (e.g., reduction in 'mode shift shock' as rated
    by human or perplexity score); Degree of successful blending of characteristics
    from both states in the output; Measurable emergence of novel properties not present
    in A or B alone.
  Achievable: Through techniques like weighted vector blending of state embeddings,
    interpolation of generative model parameters, dynamic mixing of prompt fragments,
    or controlled handover between specialized agent modules.
  Relevant: Crucial for AI agents needing stylistic flexibility, nuanced communication,
    creative conceptual blending, or the ability to navigate complex, multi-faceted
    problem spaces that defy singular ontological framings.
  Transferable: Applicable in creative AI (art, music, writing), advanced conversational
    agents (for voice/persona shifts), therapeutic AI (navigating emotional states),
    and systems for metaphorical reasoning or ontological engineering.

    current_limitations_summary: Defining 'states' in a way that allows for meaningful
      blending can be complex. Controlling emergent properties in the blended state
      is challenging.

    - User-guided navigation within a liminal landscape.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the most effective computational representations of 'cognitive states'
      for blending?
    - How can an AI learn to autonomously identify optimal liminal pathways between
      distant conceptual states?
    - Can prolonged exposure to liminal states induce novel learning or restructuring
      in AI?
