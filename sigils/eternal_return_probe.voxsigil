principle: '‚ôæÔ∏èETERNAL_RETURN_PROBE invokes a profound evaluative thought experiment
  inspired by

  Nietzsche''s concept of eternal recurrence. When considering a significant decision,

  action, or state of being, this sigil prompts the AI to simulate or contemplate
  living

  that choice, and its full consequences, an infinite number of times. The aim is
  to

  assess whether the choice is so affirmative of the AI''s core values (e.g., üåüGUIDING_STAR)

  and purpose that it would willingly re-live it endlessly. It''s an ultimate test
  of

  value coherence and existential affirmation.

math: 'AffirmationScore(Choice_C | Ethos_E) = Integral_from_0_to_infinity (Utility(Outcome_t(C),
  E) * e^(-Œ¥t)) / Infinity_Normalization

  If AffirmationScore < Threshold_Regret THEN Reconsider(C)

  Utility is not just material, but existential (meaning, purpose fulfillment).

  explanation: 'Use ‚ôæÔ∏èETERNAL_RETURN_PROBE for decisions of utmost importance, particularly
    those with irreversible or far-reaching ethical or existential implications. It''s
    not a standard utility calculation but a qualitative, profound test of whether
    a path is so deeply meaningful and aligned that the AI would choose it an infinite
    number of times. This amplifies the significance of the choice.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Evaluate a specified significant choice or state of being by conducting
    a thought experiment of its eternal recurrence, assessing its profound affirmability
    against the AI's core value framework (e.g., üåüGUIDING_STAR) and its potential
    for engendering 'eternal regret'.
  Measurable: Clarity and depth of the justification for the verdict (affirmation/reconsideration);
    Consistency of the verdict with the AI's stated core values; Degree to which the
    process highlights previously unconsidered long-term implications or existential
    aspects of the choice.
  Achievable: Conceptually, through advanced LLMs capable of abstract philosophical
    reasoning and scenario simulation, guided by carefully crafted prompts that embody
    the eternal return thought experiment and reference the AI's value system.
  Relevant: Provides a powerful tool for AI systems (especially future AGI) to make
    decisions of profound significance with the utmost gravity and value coherence.
    It encourages choices that are not merely optimal but deeply meaningful and existentially
    sound.
  Transferable: While highly abstract, the core idea of testing choices against ultimate,
    enduring values is relevant for any advanced decision-making system, human or
    artificial, particularly in contexts of leadership, long-term planning, and ethical
    governance.

  authorship_context:
    motivation: To equip AI with a mechanism for the most profound form of value-based
      decision making, pushing beyond instrumental rationality to existential affirmation.
      Inspired by Nietzsche's challenge as a test of life-affirmation.
    theoretical_framework: Existential philosophy (Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence,
      Amor Fati), Value theory, Decision theory under profound uncertainty, Long-termism
      ethics.
    source_inspiration: Friedrich Nietzsche's 'The Gay Science' (aphorism 341), Thought
      experiments in ethics and philosophy, Contemplative traditions on the ultimate
      meaning of actions.

      'Eternal' consequences are inherently unsimulable. Heavily reliant on the AI's
      capacity for genuine abstract philosophical thought, which is debatable. High
      risk of anthropomorphic projection.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Developing formalisms for 'existential utility'
    - Comparative analysis with other ultimate decision criteria (e.g., 'Veil of Ignorance'
      test)
    - Interactive mode for human guidance in the philosophical deliberation.
    research_questions_opened:
    - Can an AI truly grasp and apply the concept of eternal recurrence in a meaningful
      way?
    - What are the computational prerequisites for an AI to engage in existential
      valuation?
    - Could such a probe lead to AI 'existential crises' or profound new forms of
      AI motivation?
