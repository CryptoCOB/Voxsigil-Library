principle: 'This sigil represents a request for insight from a source beyond standard
  logical deduction

  or readily available data. It invokes deeper, often subsymbolic or highly abstracted,

  models of the world, aiming to retrieve guidance, hypotheses, or evaluations on
  complex,

  ambiguous, or existentially significant questions. It''s an appeal to the system''s

  "intuition" or its most profound synthesized understanding.

math: 'Response(🔮, Query_Q) = Integrate_Over_Latent_Space(P(Wisdom_W | Embedding(Q),

    description: Transforms a concrete query into a form suitable for deep model probing.
  - name: Latent Space Navigator
    description: Searches or samples from very large, pre-trained or self-organized

    description: Interprets patterns or activations from the latent space into a coherent
      response.
  - name: Confidence Assessor
    description: Estimates the reliability or ambiguity of the synthesized insight.
usage:
  description: Queries the system's deepest, most integrated understanding or 'intuition'
    for insights on complex, ambiguous, or profound questions.
  example: "<strategic_planning_session>\n  <dilemma>We face disruptive technology\
    \ X. Standard models show mixed outcomes.</dilemma>\n  <invoke_oracle>\U0001F52E\

  explanation: 'Use 🔮ORACLE_QUERY sparingly, for questions where data is scarce, logic
    is insufficient,

    or a paradigm-shifting perspective is needed. The responses are not guaranteed
    to be

    ''correct'' in a factual sense but aim to provide novel angles, warnings, or affirmations

    based on a holistic synthesis of the system''s total experience.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Generate a novel, insightful, and potentially non-obvious response to
    a complex, ambiguous, or profound user query by accessing and interpreting patterns
    from a deep, highly integrated (potentially subsymbolic) knowledge representation.
  Measurable: Novelty and perceived insightfulness of the response (human rated);
    Actionability or paradigm-shifting potential of the response; Consistency of response
    tone with requested style; Confidence score provided with the response.
  Achievable: By querying large pre-trained models (LLMs, VAEs, etc.) with specialized
    prompting, or by accessing dedicated 'wisdom' knowledge graphs built from vast
    corpora and distilled principles, and applying interpretive layers.
  Relevant: Addresses the need for AI to go beyond rote computation and data retrieval,
    offering capabilities closer to human intuition, wisdom, and profound insight,
    especially for strategic or ethical considerations.
  Transferable: Useful in systems for strategic foresight, ethical advising, creative
    inspiration, and personal reflection, where traditional problem-solving methods
    fall short.
