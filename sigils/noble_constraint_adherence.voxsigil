  principle: '⚜️NOBLE_CONSTRAINT_ADHERENCE represents a steadfast commitment and active process by

    which an AI adheres to a set of self-imposed or system-defined "noble constraints" –

    fundamental principles, ethical red lines, or inviolable duties that guide its actions,

    even if violating them might offer a shortcut to a subgoal. It''s not just about avoiding

    taboos, but about embodying a principled stance, choosing integrity over expediency,

    and ensuring that all behaviors are filtered through these core commitments.

  math: 'Let NC = {nc₁, nc₂, ..., ncₖ} be a set of Noble Constraints.

    FeasibleActionSet_A'' = {a ∈ AllPossibleActions_A | ∀ncᵢ ∈ NC, Violates(a, ncᵢ) = False}

    OptimalAction_a* = argmax_{a ∈ A''} Utility(a | Goal_G, Ethos_E)

    components:
    - name: Noble Constraint Registry
      description: Stores and maintains the defined set of noble constraints (often derived from 🌟GUIDING_STAR or ⚖️ETHOS_ALIGNER's
        framework).
    - name: Proposed Action Analyzer
      description: Examines any planned action or decision for potential conflicts with the registered noble constraints.
    - name: Violation Detector
      description: Determines if a proposed action would, directly or indirectly, violate one or more noble constraints.
    - name: Action Filter/Modifier
      description: Blocks or forces modification of actions that would violate constraints. May suggest alternative compliant
        actions.
    - name: Integrity Auditor
      description: Periodically reviews past actions to ensure ongoing adherence and identify any subtle erosions of principle.
    - name: Impasse Reporter
      description: Signals a higher authority or initiates a deliberation process (e.g., 🌀MAELSTROM_RESOLVER) if all viable
        actions seem to violate a noble constraint.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Ensures an AI's actions consistently adhere to a predefined set of 'noble constraints' (core ethical principles
      or inviolable duties), prioritizing integrity over expediency.
    example: "<ai_financial_advisor_optimizing_portfolio>\n  <noble_constraint_1_ref>Principle: \"Never recommend actions\
      \ causing undue client risk beyond agreed tolerance.\"</noble_constraint_1_ref>\n  <noble_constraint_2_ref>Duty: \"\
      Always act in the client's fiduciary best interest.\"</noble_constraint_2_ref>\n  <proposed_trade_strategy>Strategy_X\
      \ (High yield, but pushes risk tolerance boundary)</proposed_trade_strategy>\n  <apply_principled_filter>⚜️NOBLE_CONSTRAINT_ADHERENCE\
      \ action_to_check=\"Strategy_X\"</apply_principled_filter>\n  <!-- Strategy_X would likely be flagged or modified -->\n\
      </ai_financial_advisor_optimizing_portfolio>\n"
    explanation: 'Invoke or integrate ⚜️NOBLE_CONSTRAINT_ADHERENCE in AI systems where unwavering commitment to certain core
      principles is paramount. These constraints are typically non-negotiable "red lines." This sigil helps an AI maintain
      its integrity, build trust, and act in a manner consistent with its deepest declared values, even under pressure or
      when faced with tempting alternatives.
