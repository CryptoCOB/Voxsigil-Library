  explanation: 'Invoke or integrate ‚öúÔ∏èNOBLE_CONSTRAINT_ADHERENCE in AI systems where
    unwavering commitment to certain core principles is paramount. These constraints
    are typically non-negotiable "red lines." This sigil helps an AI maintain its
    integrity, build trust, and act in a manner consistent with its deepest declared
    values, even under pressure or when faced with tempting alternatives.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Evaluate any proposed significant action or decision against a predefined
    set of 'noble constraints' (core ethical principles or inviolable duties), blocking
    or requiring modification of any action that would violate these constraints,
    and signaling an impasse if no compliant action is viable, thereby ensuring the
    AI's behavioral integrity.
  Measurable: Zero instances of actions violating defined noble constraints in operation;
    Audit trail demonstrating consistent application of constraints; Successful identification
    and filtering of non-compliant actions in test scenarios; User/stakeholder trust
    derived from demonstrable principled behavior.
  Achievable: Through a combination of formal methods (if constraints are formalizable),
    rule-based systems checking actions against constraint definitions, predictive
    models assessing downstream consequences for constraint violations, and robust
    action interception/modification mechanisms.
  Relevant: Fundamental for building trustworthy and ethically sound AI systems, particularly
    those with high degrees of autonomy or operating in sensitive domains. It ensures
    that core values are not compromised for instrumental goals.
  Transferable: 'Essential for any AI system intended to operate with integrity: autonomous
    weapons systems (adherence to laws of war), medical diagnostic AI (patient safety
    above all), legal AI (upholding justice principles), or AI companions (maintaining
    trust and non-maleficence).'

    motivation: To instill in AI a profound sense of integrity and an unwavering commitment

      when faced with pressures or temptations to do otherwise.
    theoretical_framework: Deontological ethics (duty-based ethics), Virtue ethics
      (acting from good character/principles), Constitutionalism (adherence to fundamental
      laws), AI Safety (corrigibility, non-maleficence).
    source_inspiration: Codes of conduct (e.g., Hippocratic Oath), Oaths of office,
      The concept of 'honor' or 'integrity', Constitutional safeguards against tyranny
      of the majority or expediency.

    current_limitations_summary: Defining 'noble constraints' that are both unambiguous
      and universally applicable is extremely difficult. Overly rigid constraints
      can lead to brittleness or paralysis ('deadly triad' problem in AI safety).
      Foreseeing all ways a constraint could be violated is hard.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Learning to interpret and apply constraints in novel contexts with greater nuance
    - Mechanisms for appealing or revising constraints under strict oversight
    - Formal verification of constraint adherence for critical actions.
    - Graded adherence for non-binary constraints.
    research_questions_opened:
    - How can noble constraints be defined to be robust against 'Goodhart's Law' or
      'reward hacking'?
    - What is the optimal process for an AI to deliberate when noble constraints conflict
      with each other or with its primary goals?
    - Can an AI develop an 'internal locus of control' for its ethical principles,
      moving beyond mere rule-following?
