principle: 'This sigil represents a dynamic interface for grafting, integrating, and
  contextualizing

  external knowledge into an agent''s cognitive workspace. It is not merely a data
  lookup,

  but a process of actively weaving new information into existing understanding,

  establishing meaningful semantic links, and updating internal models. It''s the
  point

  of assimilation where raw data becomes actionable knowledge.

usage:
  description: Integrates external knowledge into the agent's current understanding,
    enriching context and enabling informed reasoning.
  example: "<reasoning_task>\n  <current_hypothesis>X leads to Y</current_hypothesis>\n\
    \  <invoke_knowledge_graft>\U0001F9ECNEXUS source=\"ScientificJournals\" query=\"\

  explanation: 'Use 🧬NEXUS whenever an agent needs to incorporate new information
    from external sources

    to perform a task, validate a hypothesis, or deepen its understanding. It manages
    the

    full lifecycle from identifying an information need to integrating the answer.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Retrieve targeted information from a specified external source, parse
    it semantically, validate it, and integrate it into the agent's existing knowledge
    structures at a defined depth, updating internal models and creating relevant
    links.
  Measurable: Successful retrieval of relevant information; Number of meaningful semantic
    links created; Improvement in task performance post-integration; Consistency of
    integrated knowledge with existing trusted knowledge.
  Achievable: Through APIs to knowledge bases, web scraping (with appropriate parsing),
    semantic analysis modules, and knowledge graph update mechanisms.
  Relevant: Fundamental for any AI that needs to learn, adapt to new information,
    stay current, or operate with knowledge beyond its initial training set.
  Transferable: Applicable to chatbots, research assistants, decision support systems,
    and any AI requiring dynamic knowledge acquisition.
