  principle: 'This sigil represents a theoretical cognitive process that actively consumes or draws insight from states of
    high entropy, conceptual decay, or even "nothingness" (the void of unformed ideas). Instead of merely filtering entropy
    (like 🜜NEGENT_FILTER), it seeks to metabolize it, transforming randomness, obsolescence, or absence into novel structures,
    energy for new thought, or foundational axioms for previously unconsidered paradigms. It is the symbolic act of finding
    pattern in pure chaos or meaning in the void.

    components:
    - name: Entropy Source Identifier
      description: Detects and characterizes regions of high symbolic entropy, information decay, or conceptual gaps.
    - name: Void Sampling Unit
      description: Probes or samples the 'texture' of the entropy or void, looking for subtle pre-patterns or resonances.
    - name: Pattern Seeding Kernel
      description: An internal bias or minimal structure that interacts with the sampled void-stuff to nucleate new patterns.
    - name: Structure Crystallizer
      description: Amplifies and stabilizes emergent patterns into coherent symbolic structures or insights.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Invokes a process to draw novel insights or conceptual structures from highly entropic states, information
      decay, or apparent nothingness. A mechanism for extreme novelty generation.

    explanation: 'Use 🌌COSMIC_ENTROPY_CONSUMPTION when all conventional avenues of thought are exhausted, or when seeking
      truly radical novelty. It''s a high-risk, high-reward cognitive operation that attempts to "create something from nothing"
      or find profound order in utter disorder. It''s the cognitive equivalent of a black hole that emits Hawking radiation
      in the form of new ideas.
