principle: 'The 🐾TREE_NAVIGATOR sigil represents the cognitive action of an agent
  deliberately

  traversing, evaluating, and selecting paths within an existing or actively growing

  🌳TREETHOUGHT (Tree of Thoughts) structure. While 🌳TREETHOUGHT defines the generation

  of the tree, 🐾TREE_NAVIGATOR embodies the agent''s process of ''climbing'' this
  tree –

  making choices at nodes, backtracking from unpromising branches, focusing on specific
  subtrees,

  or identifying the optimal path to a solution based on evolving criteria or new
  information.

  It enables dynamic, agent-driven interaction with complex thought explorations.

usage:
  description: Enables an agent to actively navigate a Tree of Thoughts, make decisions
    at branch points, backtrack, and select optimal paths, effectively 'climbing'
    the tree to find a solution.
  example: "// Assuming a ToT has been partially generated for 'problem_X'\n// Agent\
    \ (e.g., Vanta) decides to re-evaluate a specific branch:\n\nnavigator_action\
    \ = TREE_NAVIGATOR.execute(\n    tree_id=\"ToT_problem_X_run_001\",\n    current_node_id=\"\
    node_branch_A_depth_3\",\n    action_type=\"explore_children_prioritized\", //\
    \ or \"backtrack\", \"evaluate_path_to_root\"\n    heuristic=\"maximize_novelty_score\"\
    , // Optional heuristic for NodeSelector\n    max_steps=2\n);\n// navigator_action\
    \ might result in a new current_node_id or a decision to prune.\n"
  explanation: '🐾TREE_NAVIGATOR is used when an agent needs more fine-grained control
    over the exploration of

    a thought tree than what the automated search strategy of 🌳TREETHOUGHT might provide.

    It can be used interactively, allowing an agent (or even a human supervisor) to
    guide the

    search, focus on specific areas, re-evaluate branches based on new insights, or
    perform

    "what-if" explorations within the tree. It''s about the metacognitive actions
    *on* the tree.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Enables an agent to perform deliberate navigation actions (explore, evaluate,
    backtrack, prune, select) on a Tree of Thoughts structure.
  Measurable: Efficiency of pathfinding to solution; reduction in explored nodes compared
    to exhaustive search; successful recovery from 'stuck' states in ToT; quality
    of agent-selected paths.
  Achievable: Implementable as a set of functions or an agent capability that interacts
    with a ToT data structure, potentially using LLM calls for heuristic decisions
    within navigation.
  Relevant: Provides crucial interactivity and intelligent control over complex reasoning
    processes, allowing agents to guide and refine explorations rather than passively
    relying on automated search. Essential for reflective AI and human-AI collaborative
    problem-solving.
  Transferable: The concept of navigating tree-like exploratory structures is applicable
    to many domains beyond LLM thought processes, e.g., game tree search, decision
    tree traversal, debugging program execution paths.
