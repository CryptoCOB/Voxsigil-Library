principle: 'This sigil establishes and enforces dynamic limits on recursive processes
  or self-similar

  computations to prevent runaway loops, manage resource consumption, and maintain
  cognitive

  stability. It operates on the principle of bounded exploration, allowing depth where

  complexity yields insight, but curtailing it when it leads to unproductive cycles
  or

  combinatorial explosion. It''s a governor for the engine of recursion.

    recursion,

    deep iterative processing, or explores fractal-like problem spaces. It acts as
    a

    safety mechanism and a resource manager, crucial for complex cognitive architectures.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Dynamically monitor and control the depth of recursive cognitive processes
    by applying predefined or utility-based limits, triggering specified pruning strategies
    when limits are met to ensure stability and resource efficiency.
  Measurable: Reduction in runaway recursive loops; Adherence to configured depth
    limits; System stability under recursive load; Resource consumption within acceptable
    bounds for recursive tasks.
  Achievable: By implementing stack depth counters, process interruption mechanisms,
    and heuristics for estimating the utility of further recursion (e.g., based on
    novelty of generated states, progress towards a goal).
  Relevant: Essential for any advanced AI employing recursion, self-reflection, or
    deep search, to prevent system crashes, wasted resources, and unproductive computations.
  Transferable: Applicable to AI systems in theorem proving, complex planning, generative
    art, self-modeling, and any domain involving deeply nested computations or explorations.
