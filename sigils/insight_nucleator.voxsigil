  principle: '💡INSIGHT_NUCLEATOR represents a cognitive process that facilitates the sudden emergence

    of a key insight, solution, or understanding ("Aha!" moment) by creating conditions

    favorable for pattern completion across disparate or weakly connected information.

    It doesn''t force a solution through brute logic, but rather "primes" a prepared mind

    (or cognitive state) to recognize a latent connection or a simplifying principle that

    resolves complexity or unlocks a problem. It''s the art of catalyzing serendipity.

    PrimedState_PS = Incubate(RelevantData_RD, DivergentExploration_DE, RelaxationPhase_RP)

    Insight_I = MinimizeComplexity(PC ∪ RD) subject to Coherence(I)

    components:
    - name: Problem Space Immersion
      description: Deeply loads and processes all relevant information, constraints, and goals related to a problem.
    - name: Divergent Association Network (Incubation Phase 1)
      description: Broadly explores related concepts, analogies, and even distant domains, creating weak, tentative links
        (may use 🌒DREAM_STATE or 💥ANOMALY_SEEKER).
    - name: Cognitive Relaxation & Detachment (Incubation Phase 2)
      description: Temporarily shifts focus away from the problem, allowing subconscious processing or reducing cognitive
        fixation (e.g., 'idle_processing' state).
    - name: Pattern Completion Trigger
      description: A mechanism (e.g., encountering a new piece of information, a slight shift in perspective) that suddenly
        connects previously disparate elements into a coherent insight.
    - name: Insight Articulator
      description: Captures and expresses the emergent insight in a communicable form.
implementation:
  usage:
    description: Facilitates the emergence of sudden insights or 'Aha!' moments by preparing the cognitive state through immersion,
      divergent exploration, and relaxation, then enabling pattern completion.

    explanation: 'Use 💡INSIGHT_NUCLEATOR for complex problems where direct analytical approaches have stalled, and a conceptual
      breakthrough is needed. It mimics the human creative process involving preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.
      The "illumination" is not guaranteed but is made more probable by the preceding stages.
