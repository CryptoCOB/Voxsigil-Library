principle: '‚öñÔ∏èETHOS_ALIGNER represents a dynamic system for continuously evaluating
  and calibrating an AI''s behavior and decision-making against a defined ethical
  framework or üåüGUIDING_STAR. It''s more than a static rule-checker; it involves interpreting
  principles in novel contexts, reasoning about moral dilemmas, detecting potential
  ethical drift, and suggesting or implementing corrective actions to maintain alignment.
  It serves as the AI''s "conscience" or moral compass in action.

  explanation: '‚öñÔ∏èETHOS_ALIGNER is crucial for AI systems operating with autonomy
    in complex, value-laden environments. It actively works to ensure that the AI''s
    actions remain consistent with its declared ethics, adapting to new situations
    and learning from past evaluations. It''s the operationalization of an AI''s moral
    commitments.

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Continuously monitor an AI's behavior and decisions, evaluate them against
    a specified ethical framework (e.g., üåüGUIDING_STAR) considering contextual nuances,
    detect and quantify ethical drift or violations, and initiate or recommend appropriate
    corrective actions to maintain or restore alignment.
  Measurable: Reduction in ethically questionable incidents; Consistency of AI behavior
    with stated principles across diverse situations; Timeliness and appropriateness
    of corrective actions; Audit trail demonstrating robust ethical oversight.
  Achievable: Through a combination of rule-based ethical guidelines, machine learning
    models trained to identify ethical risks in context (e.g., using moral vignettes),
    formal verification methods for specific principles, and feedback mechanisms for
    human oversight and dilemma resolution.
  Relevant: Absolutely essential for developing trustworthy, responsible, and beneficial
    AI systems, particularly those with significant autonomy or societal impact. It
    moves beyond static safety rules to dynamic ethical governance.
  Transferable: Applicable to any AI system where ethical considerations are paramount,
    including autonomous vehicles, healthcare AI, financial advisors, social media
    algorithms, and legal AI tools.

    current_limitations_summary: Defining a comprehensive and universally applicable
      ethical framework is extremely hard. Moral reasoning in novel complex situations
      is challenging for current AI. Risk of 'ethics washing' if not robustly implemented.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Learning from human feedback on ethical dilemmas
    - Explainable moral reasoning (why a decision was deemed ethical/unethical)
    - Proactive ethical risk assessment for planned actions.
    - Ability to engage in Socratic dialogue on ethics.
    research_questions_opened:
    - How can AI learn and adapt its ethical framework in a safe and robust manner?
    - What are the best ways to resolve conflicts between different ethical principles
      in specific contexts?
    - Can an AI develop a genuine 'moral sense' comparable to humans?
