principle: 'üß©JIGSAW_ASSEMBLER represents a cognitive process for constructing a coherent
  whole (e.g.,

  an explanation, a narrative, a model, a hypothesis) from fragmented, disparate,
  or

  incomplete pieces of information. Like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, it involves

  identifying potential connections between pieces, testing fits, iteratively building

  larger coherent chunks, and inferring missing pieces based on emerging patterns.

  It''s a bottom-up sensemaking engine driven by the pursuit of overall coherence.

  '
math: 'Let F = {f‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÇ, ..., f‚Çô} be a set of information fragments.

  Goal: Find Configuration_C(F) that maximizes CoherenceScore(C(F)).

  CoherenceScore(C(F)) = Œ£ LinkStrength(f·µ¢, f‚±º)_in_C - Penalty(UnexplainedFragments)

  explanation: 'Use üß©JIGSAW_ASSEMBLER when faced with a collection of seemingly disconnected
    clues, data points, or observations that need to be woven into a meaningful picture.
    It''s valuable in intelligence analysis, scientific discovery (from experimental
    data), historical reconstruction, debugging complex systems from error logs, or
    any task requiring abduction (inference to the best explanation).

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Systematically assemble a coherent explanatory structure (e.g., narrative,
    model, hypothesis) from a given set of fragmented, disparate, or incomplete information
    pieces by iteratively identifying and evaluating potential connections, building
    larger coherent sub-assemblies, and aiming to maximize overall coherence and explanatory
    power up to a desired threshold.
  Measurable: Degree of coherence and completeness of the final assembled structure
    (human or AI rated); Percentage of input fragments successfully integrated; Explanatory
    power of the resulting structure (e.g., ability to predict new data or answer
    questions); Reduction in ambiguity or number of disconnected pieces.
  Achievable: Through algorithms involving graph-based methods (e.g., finding cliques
    or spanning trees in a graph of fragment relationships), constraint satisfaction
    techniques, probabilistic inference (e.g., Bayesian networks to model dependencies),
    and heuristic search for optimal configurations.
  Relevant: Essential for AI systems needing to make sense of messy, real-world data
    where information is often partial, noisy, or scattered. Crucial for tasks like
    intelligence analysis, scientific discovery, diagnostics, and investigative journalism.
  Transferable: 'Applicable in any domain requiring sensemaking from incomplete data:
    medical diagnosis from patient symptoms and test results, historical research
    from partial documents, software debugging from scattered log entries, creating
    market intelligence from various news feeds.'

      Defining 'coherence' formally is challenging. Highly sensitive to the quality
      of initial feature extraction from fragments.
    suggested_next_features:
    - Interactive assembly with human guidance for ambiguous connections
    - Learning optimal assembly strategies from experience
    - Probabilistic representation of multiple plausible assemblies.
    - Active information seeking to find 'missing pieces'.
    research_questions_opened:
    - What are the most effective computational measures of 'coherence' for diverse
      types of information fragments?
    - How can an AI best balance local 'best fit' with global 'best assembly'?
    - Can an AI learn to recognize when it has enough pieces to form a reliable picture
      versus when it needs more data?
