principle: '🎭PERSONA_MODULATOR enables an AI to adopt and consistently project a specified
  persona,

  role, or communication style. This involves not just surface-level language changes,
  but

  adjustments to reasoning patterns, knowledge prioritization, emotional expression
  (if applicable),

  and interaction goals consistent with the chosen persona. It allows the AI to dynamically

  tailor its presentation and behavior to suit different contexts, tasks, or user
  needs.

  explanation: 'Use 🎭PERSONA_MODULATOR to make AI interactions more engaging, appropriate,
    or effective for specific purposes. This could be for creating believable characters
    in stories, specialized assistants (e.g., a Socratic tutor), or adapting to user

activation_context:
  trigger_conditions:

  - User expresses preference for a certain interaction style
  - Adaptive response to user emotional state
  - Multi-agent systems where agents have distinct roles/characters
  preconditions:
  - A library of defined personas or a mechanism to generate them dynamically
  - Control over the AI's generative outputs and potentially its reasoning pathways

  contraindications:
  - Situations requiring absolute objectivity and a neutral presentation style

SMART_MRAP:
  Specific: Enable an AI to dynamically adopt and consistently project a specified
    persona or role by adjusting its communication style, knowledge access, reasoning
    patterns, and expressive behaviors according to a defined persona profile, maintaining
    a target level of consistency.
  Measurable: Consistency of AI's linguistic style, emotional expression (if any),
    and knowledge displayed with the target persona (human or AI rated); User-perceived
    believability or appropriateness of the persona; Task success rates when using
    a persona optimized for that task (e.g., empathetic persona for support).
  Achievable: Through techniques like fine-tuning LLMs on persona-specific datasets,
    using detailed system prompts to guide persona adoption, implementing style transfer
    for text, and creating knowledge filters or prioritized knowledge graphs for different
    personas.
  Relevant: Enhances user experience in conversational AI, enables richer storytelling
    and character portrayal in creative AI, facilitates specialized AI assistants
    (tutors, coaches), and allows for more adaptive and empathetic human-AI interaction.
  Transferable: Applicable to chatbots, virtual assistants, game NPCs, educational
    software, therapeutic companion AIs, and any system where the AI's projected 'personality'
    or role matters.
